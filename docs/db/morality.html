<a name='1b59dbca' /><h4>Talk Therapy and Morality</h4>
<div class="note-body"><p>Talk therapy is bounded by morality, a problem vividly illustrated in <em>The Sopranos</em> which centers around a mafia boss and his relationship with his therapist. What if in order to be happy, you have to be selfish and commit crimes? At one point, homosexuality was amoral, and therapists went to lengths to remove it from their clients. Or consider couples therapy. Many healthy realtionships require self-deception (i.e. love) in order to bridge the great divide in agendas between the sexes. Even if this suggestion is wrong, the fact that it is forbidden indicates that there is a whole swath of insight that is not only ignored, but actively avoided, in therapy.</p>
