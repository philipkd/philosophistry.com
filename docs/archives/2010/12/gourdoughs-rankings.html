<h1>Gourdough's Rankings</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Sunday Dec 12, 2010  2:09 AM

<p>I'm not a dessert person, nor would I consider myself a foodie, but I temporarily become one, when I decided to eat every doughnut at least once at <a href="http://www.gourdoughs.com/">Gourdough's</a>, a specialty doughnut trailer in Austin, TX.</p>

<p>I stopped by the trailer randomly on a whim, and I was overwhelmed by the choices. So I picked the simplest one, the Naughty & Nice (sugar and cinnamon), and I was blown away. I thought to myself, "wow, this is like art for your mouth," and I determined right there, that I wanted to try them all.</p>

<p>And so, over the course of a couple months, I convinced my friends to come join me on my quest. Nobody I brought was ever disappointed, and I converted about thirty people to Gourghdough's. If I couldn't bring anybody along, I'd sometimes go by myself. One time I went at 2:50am on a Saturday night, just to get a fix. (Yes, they're open late. I got a PB&J). </p>

<p>And so, without further adieu, here's how I ranked every doughnut:</p>

<p><style>ol.gourdoughs li { margin-bottom: 10px; }</style></p>

<ol class="gourdoughs">
<li><b>Porkey's</b><br><i>canadian bacon, cream cheese and jalapeno jelly</i><br>I love eggs benedicts, and therefore I love canadian bacon. I also love cream cheese. You might be wondering about the jalapeno jelly, and yes, it's really unique, and yet the whole thing comes together in the perfect balance of savory and sweet.
<li><b>Blue Balls</b><br><i>blueberry filling with blue icing</i>
<li><b>Naughty & Nice</b><br><i>sugar and cinnamon</i><br>I love how their simplest doughnut is also one their best. If you never had Gourdough's before, and you're unsure about what to pick, start with this one.
<li><b>Dirty Berry</b><br><i>fudge icing with grilled strawberries</i>
<li><b>Cherry Bombs</b><br><i>glazed cherry-topped holes, cinnamon, sugar and cake mix topping</i>
<li><b>Mama's Cake</b><br><i>yellow cake batter filling with chocolate fudge icing</i>
<li><b>Flying Pig</b><br><i>bacon with maple syrup icing</i><br>Tastes like a great pancake.
<li><b>Bring the Heath</b><br><i>cream cheese icing with heath bar chips</i>
<li><b>Razzle Dazzle</b><br><i>raspberry filling with fudge icing</i>
<li><b>Heavenly Hash</b><br><i>marshmallow with chocolate fudge icing topped with fudge candy</i>
<li><b>Black Out</b><br><i>brownie batter, fudge icing and chocolate covered brownie bites</i>
<li><b>PB&J</b><br><i>grape jelly filling with peanut butter icing and peanut butter morsels</i><br>Like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, to the extreme.
<li><b>Sara's Joy</b><br><i>coconut flavored filling with fresh coconut and fudge icing</i><br>I'm just not sure about coconuts mixed with doughnut.
<li><b>Baby Rattler</b><br><i>fudge icing and fudge oreos with a gummy rattlesnake</i>
<li><b>Slow Burn</b><br><i>habanero pepper jelly with cream cheese topping</i><br>Not as interesting as the Porkey's, and the jalapeno jelly is much better than the habanero.
<li><b>Son of a Peach</b><br><i>peach filling, cinnamon, sugar and cake mix topping</i>
<li><b>Funky Monkey</b><br><i>grilled bananas and cream cheese icing with brown sugar</i>
<li><b>Granny's Pie</b><br><i>caramel, pecans, bananas and graham cracker</i>
<li><b>Miss Shortcake</b><br><i>cream chese icing with fresh cut strawberries</i><br>In an informal poll among my friends, this doughnut and the Naughty & Nice are the best. Unfortunately, strawberries are really only good to me with whip cream or chocolate.
<li><b>Sailor Jerry</b><br><i>think rum cake</i><br>Too soggy, like a doughnut dunked in rum, which overwhelms the flavors.
<li><b>ODB</b><br><i>cream filled doughnut holes with icing rolled in coconut</i><br>See "Sarah's Joy" above for my comment on coconuts.
<li><b>The Puddin'</b><br><i>cream filled, cream cheese icing, bananas and vanilla wafers</i>
<li><b>Mother Clucker</b><br><i>fried chicken strip with honey butter</i><br>Tastes like a biscuit.
</ol>
Thank you to everybody who joined me on this adventure.
