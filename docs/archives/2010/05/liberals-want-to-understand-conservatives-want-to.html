<h1>Liberals want to understand, conservatives want to forget</h1>

<p>Why is it that liberals are more interested in understanding the conservative mind than conservatives are? There's liberal books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931498717/philosophistr-20/ref=nosim/">Don't Think of an Elephant</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080507774X/philosophistr-20/ref=nosim/">What's the Matter with Kansas?</a> while as conservatives have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000RWD3JG/philosophistr-20/ref=nosim/">Liberalism is a Mental disorder: Savage Solutions</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400054184/philosophistr-20/ref=nosim/">How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)</a>. An uncharitable interpretation is that liberals are wusses, and more interested in understanding their captors. Remember how after 9/11, liberals wanted to assign the Koran as required reading for college students. Then again, a charitable interpretation is that liberals adhere to the "know your enemy" principle.<br />

I think the polarization shared by the media and our political system is evidence for that. And the attempt to require college students to read the koran was not so they could "know their enemy", it was done to prevent backlash on people who appeared "middle-eastern" by educating people on the differences between Islamic Extremists and the normal everyday Muslims. From what I remember,  the people who attacked someone who looked "middle-eastern" didn't have the best educational or economic background.  So asside from trampling  the 1st amendment I doubt it would have had any effect. Don't get me wrong though I think a comprehensive education of theology should be taught in schools, but that's a different discussion completely.</p></p>
