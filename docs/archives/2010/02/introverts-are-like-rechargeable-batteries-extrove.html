<h1>Introverts are like rechargeable batteries. Extroverts are like solar panels.</h1>

<p>Another interesting bit from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761123695/philosophistr-20/ref=nosim/">The Introvert Advantage</a>:<blockquote class="huff">Introverts are like a rechargeable battery. They need to stop expending energy and rest in order to recharge. This is what a less stimulating environment provides for introverts. it restores energy. It is their natural niche.<p/>Extroverts are like solar panels. For extroverts, being alone, or <i>inside</i>, is like living under a heavy cloud cover. Solar panels need the sun to recharge&mdash;extroverts need to be out and about to refuel. Like introversion, extroversion is a hard-wired temperament. It cannot be changed. You can learn to work <i>with</i> it, not <i>against</i> it</blockquote>I think ideas like introversion-extroversion, highly-sensitive people, or Jung's types are best internalized as spectrums that help you see the world in a different light. I think thinking about black-and-white like, "this person's X, that person's Y," can actually do more harm than good in some cases. On the other hand, to know that someone's traits organize around a pole or that some traits come in groups, can be very helpful to understanding people, and very liberating to identify in yourself.<br />

This reminded me of an article in  The Atlantic called "Caring for Your Introvert," http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/2696/.</p></p>
