<h1>In politics, when you are explaining, you are losing.</h1>

<p>Interesting article in the BBC, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8474611.stm">Why do people vote against their own interests?</a><blockquote class="huff">As the saying goes, in politics, when you are explaining, you are losing. And that makes anything as complex or as messy as healthcare reform a very hard sell.</blockquote></p>

<p>Here's an exchange during a debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000:<blockquote class="huff">Gore: "Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries."<p/>Bush: "Look, this is a man who has great numbers. He talks about numbers. I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the internet, but he invented the calculator. It's fuzzy math. It's trying to scare people in the voting booth.</blockquote>(via <a href="http://www.ryskamp.org/brain/?p=3771">ryskamp</a>)<br />
