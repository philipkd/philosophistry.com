<h1>Is the Google IPO the Cluetrain Manifesto in action?</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Friday Apr 30, 2004  8:23 AM 
<br><a href="/archives/google.html">Google</a></h2>

<p>At the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, when companies were spending their time talking about gathering "eyeballs" and building up "brands," some hippie-like geeks proposed the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>.  It's a statement that urges businesses to get a clue and start treating customers like people rather than cattle and treat the Internet like a conversation instead of another marketing platform.</p>

<p>That Google has suceeded ridiculously well with a "Don't Be Evil" policy and that the dot-com's crashed soon after "cluetrain" may be a testament to the power of a Cluetrain-like form of business.</p>

<p>Yesterday Google applied for an Initial Public Offering, and this is what their filing says:</p>

<blockquote>The letter states, among other things, that 1. We don't need to do this for the money; 2. We have no plans to run our business to satisfy Wall Street's need for smooth earnings predictability; 3. We plan to give no earnings guidance, not at least as it's understood on Wall St.; 4. Don't ask us to do so, we'll simply decline the request; 5. We'll do odd things that you won' t understand; 6. We will make big bets on things that may not work out; 7. We run the company as a triumvirate, so there will not be clear leadership from one person like most other companies; 8. We bridge the media and tech industries (interesting), which are in flux, so we've chosen a two-class stock structure similar to the NYT, WashPost, and NYT that helps us avoid being taken over by those forces; 9. We plan using an auction model, as it feels fairer and we understand auctions from AdWords; 10. Don't invest in us if this scares you at all, or the price feels too high; 11. Don't even think about asking us to cut expenses with regard to our employees; 12. We believe in the idea of Don't Be Evil; 13. It's evil to pay for placement or inclusion (a swipe at Yahoo); 14. We hope to bridge the digital divide through Gmail type free services and a foundation with at least 1% of profits and equity to help make the world a better place; 17. Betting on Google is a bet on Sergey and Larry (this was said multiple times, making me wonder if there wasn't some odd future blame being assigned here by the VCs or bankers); 18. This letter is our way of answering the questions we can't answer in the coming months due to the IPO quiet period.</blockquote>

<p>This is a revolutionary statement coming from a business.  The tone of this announcement is not from a CEO hungry for money but more like a professor attempting to float some idealistic, utopian vision of capitalism.  I found it cluetrain-like in its rejection of the standard "corporation as shark" mentality.</p>

<p>However, it can be interpreted as arrogance: Sergey and Larry are practically saying, "We are God, and we know it. So back off."</p>

<p>Everything about Google can be duplicated.  There is no market lock-in like eBay or Microsoft.  I don't know how their IPO will fare, but I do know that the genius or arrogance of their filing letter will depend immensly on circumstances over the next three years.

<p>Google's IPO should get "Don't Be Evil" a lot of publicity--and when people dig into it a bit, they'll find that it's not just an empty corporate catchphrase.</p>

<p>Google has lived this philosophy, and they're not just being altruistic -- it's paid off big time. By refusing to let ad dollars corrupt search results, they've become #1 in search. Users trust Google not to tamper with their information just to make a quick buck.</p>

<p>I'm exploring how the Don't Be Evil ethic applies not only to Google, but to business, politics and the media. I'd be honored to get feedback on my site, <a href="http://www.dontbeevil.com" rel="nofollow">www.dontbeevil.com</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></p>
