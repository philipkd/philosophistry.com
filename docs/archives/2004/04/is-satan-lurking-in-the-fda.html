<h1>Is Satan Lurking in the FDA?</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/2496556">The FDA kept secret a study showing children who take anti-depressents are twice as likely to commit suicide.</a></p>

<p>Why?????  I smell a devil in the midst.  Drug companies make bank from selling pills to kids.  I'm not calling conspiracy on this one, yet, but I want this to be examined.  Some lawsuits please?</p>

<p>I'm especially enraged because this is another example of the little people getting crushed.  Parents and children who don't have the technical expertise to analyze info on drugs have to trust the tribe to instruct them.   If our lack of quality information is doubling the rate of suicides, then what we have is a eugenics that eliminates the uninformed.</p>

<p><I>Note: The Passion of the Christ hoopla has drowned me in religious-speak.  Expect more mentions of the devil, lucifer, satan, beezlebub, et. al.</i><br />
<h2>Comments</h2><p>brandon said on April 11, 2004  4:15 PM: <p>when they first began running articles in the local about the 'discovery' that antidepressents led to suicide, especially in children, i laughed and skimmed past the articles.<br />
Not because this is something to be taken lightly. Because I'd read the same information in an underground paper nearly 3 years ago.</p></p>

...and I've read (in a psych text book) that antidepressants like Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro perform just as well as sugar placebos in reducing "depression."  Maybe some people start taking antidepressants, notice no improvement, then commit suicide rather than resigning themselves to a life of permanent depression.  Other medicines such as Lithium Bicarbonate for Bi-polar disorder do perform quite well, however.      </p></p>
<p>garret said on April 12, 2004 11:10 PM: <p>Well, obviously kids who take these pills are gonna be more likely to commit suicide becuase they were the ones who were depressed in the first place?  Am I missing something here??  This just proves that Prozac isn't 100%.  The only way to prove this would be to do a double blind placebo study, which would be unfair becuase you'd have to convince kids that you were giving them antidepressants when they were actually getting sugar pills.</p>

I think I over-reacted on this one.</p>

<p>But on a separate note, why hide the data?</p></p>
<p>garret said on April 13, 2004  1:32 AM: <p>Probably some combination of fear of the study being misconstrued and clout, I'm guessing?  I'm sure pharmaceutical companies want us all to think that their pills are the best way to fight depression, even though they may not work for everyone.  I tend to think that psychologists prefer to tell their patients that depression will be a lifelong problem with studies to back it up, becuase to them, that is a lifelong flow of cash.  Not to say that some people aren't more succeptible to depression, but you have to ask yourself how hard these people are trying to break the cycle.<br />
</p></p>
<p>brandon said on April 13, 2004  6:32 AM: <p>ever read the book Prozac Nation? It came out a few years ago, and it's about that fallacy - that antidepressents and other such drugs are given to patients as a crutch, rather than a stepping-stone to health. and, of course, the guy who wrote it (name escapes me) has plenty of evidence to back his own side up.</p>

<p>it seems as long as psychology views men as reactionary beings, the truth will not present itself.</p></p>
<p><a title="http://www.philosophistry.com/" href="http://www.philosophistry.com/" rel="nofollow">Philip Dhingra</a> said on April 13, 2004  7:56 AM: <p>What if the psychiatry profession is just another evolutionary <a href="http://www.philosophistry.com/archives/2003/04/000057.html" rel="nofollow">spandrel</a> or a negative meme that's locked-in.</p>

<p>A way it could be a negative meme is that it is hard for the lay man to refute the psychiatrist, just as it is hard to refute the priest.</p>

<p>By visiting priests, psychiatrists, and/or shamans, one could just be engaging in a social function.  Another opportunity to talk to a group of people that society deems important.  For the rich, visiting expensive counselors is just another service, like going to the spa, that their class can collectively engage in.</p>

<p>This is all pure punditry though, I haven't ever been to a psychiatrist nor I haven't done my homework.  Most of what I know is from stuff like the Sopranos.  I've heard the one-third's statistic passed around, that one-third of people are better off after visiting a psychiatrist, one-third are the same, and one-third are worse.  But that is just hearsay.  Personally, I'd only see a psychatrist if I had a strange psychosis, like schitzophrenia, but not because I was really sad for a long time.</p>

<p>Yeah, I heard about Prozac nation--*sigh*, yet another example of humans architecting their own demise through superstructures; a nation that makes us depressed and then gives us the drug to "cure" it.</p></p>
<p>brandon said on April 13, 2004  9:38 PM: <p>i think you hit the nail on the head - psychiatrists are the modern shamans.</p></p>
<p>Dana said on May  2, 2004  5:58 PM: <p>From what I have personally seen and my opinion only, these type of drugs are given to anyone and there are no two people alike on earth.<br />
Everyone has different brain chemicals and these drugs are doing things to some people that are not repairable.</p>

<p>I have seen these drugs change nice people and some of the drugs cause you to act like a drunken person would and you say things that you would not say without the drugs and make decisions that you would not normally do. <br />
In other words they make you have less inhibitions. I have also seen people do things that they would never do without taking these drugs. Such as a person who would never blow their nose in public, do so. This is small compared to what could be really going on.<br />
I believe this may have something to do with the suicides and after watching newspaper articles for years, every time there would be a crime or suicide, I checked if the article said they were on antidepressents and many were.</p>

<p>Doctors are not treating us anymore the drug companies are.</p></p>
<p>Dana said on May  2, 2004  6:06 PM: <p>Are these drugs given to people that are really depressed?<br />
I see them given out for everything.<br />
Any ache or pain, doctors give them out. It is a money making drug and before it was hormones for women and look what that did. Also the diet drug that caused heart problems was given very easily.<br />
The FDA is checking some drugs for a very short period of time now and given approval very fast.</p>

<p>Are you depressed over a certain thing that happened or depressed for no reason. There is an important difference here.  I think an amount of depression is normal and means something you may want to talk about and that can heal a great deal but can be very inexpensive to accomplish.</p></p>
