<h1>Billionaire Mark Cuban slams Donald Trump on his blog</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Monday Apr 19, 2004  8:49 AM

<p>Mark Cuban is the richest blogger in the world.  Check out <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/">his blog, BlogMaverick</a>.  Cuban made $2 billion selling broadband media provider Broadcast.com to Yahoo.  Read <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/onair/2020/2020_000504_billionaire_feature.html">some bio bits here</a>.</p>

<p>On his blog he has an entry where <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/8277407862895830/">he slams Donald Trump</a> by describing his personal encounters with the man.  Read the juicy tidbits there yourself.  It's a nice peak into how immature and normal these rich kids are.</p>

<blockquote>After leaving your office, I promised myself that if I ever got liquid and had an obscene amount of money in the bank, I would make a point not to remind myself and everyone else around me of it every minute of every day â€” unlike you.  (<a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/8277407862895830/">read the rest</a>)</blockquote>

<p>This brings blogging to a new level.  It shows how blogging and the Internet has compressed the world into a tighter global village; we now have access to more intimate details of the interactions between alpha males.  While we maybe had this before in a few random interviews or in a book, this is one of the earliest times that you see it done live and unprompted by an interviewer.  The bulk of current media via TV and print, only displays the dramatic side of celebrities: either the heights of their charisma or the lows of their criminal behavior.  What comes out is this false impression that these celebrities are somehow super-human.  The honest truth, as Cuban's blog helps reveals, is that they are jus as stupid as the rest of us.  It therefore gives hope to the common people that they can rise up if they wanted to as well.</p>

<p>Note: he is probably not a billionaire anymore due to the dot-bomb's crashing his Yahoo stock.</p>

<p>Second Note: I remember Tommy Lee used to dish slime at other celebrities, like Kid Rock, via his band's site a few years ago.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Third Note: Yeah, Cuban's obviously doing this to help promote his show; it seems he's taking donald's on-camera remarks too seriously otherwise.<br />
