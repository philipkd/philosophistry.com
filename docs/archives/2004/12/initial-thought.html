<h1>Initial Thoughts on Flow</h1>

<p>Ah.  To wake up without an alarm clock and look forward to the work that I'm about to do.  To sit atop a Sunday evening and see a week of opportunity and enjoyment.  To feel content with the subject of my life.</p>

<p>These are things I don't have, but yearn to have.</p>

<p>I've picked up this book by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced "chicks-sent-me-high") titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/philosophistr-20/0060920432?v=glance">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a>.  By understanding flow, perhaps I can understand the ingredients of a rich work-narrative.  One suggested ingredient is the structure of a game: rules, feedback, goals, rewards, and control.</p>

<p>Another suggested ingredient is personal growth.  I found this chart helpful:</p>

<p>Anxiety is evidence of an over-challenging task.  Boredom is evidence of something that's too easy.  If you glide the sweet spot of balance between challenges and skills, then you are more likely to flow.</p>

<p>I interpret this to mean that work-flow comes when you frequently feel personal improvement.  In addition, my personal addendum is that you should care where the improvement goes.  For example, sure I can improve my skills at playing chess, but at the end of the day who cares?</p>

<p>Three sources have led me to stumble upon this book:<br />
1. I was in the dorms, bored, and asked a random student for a book, perhaps one on psychology&mdash;he handed me Flow.<br />
2. Blog buddy <a href="http://www.ryskamp.org/brain/">Bob Ryskamp</a> has referred to the book a couple of times.  Check out his <a href="http://ryskamp.org/brain/personal/an-autotelic-new-year.html">An Autotelic New Year</a> and <a href="http://www.philosophistry.com/archives/2004/06/001112.html">my own comments</a>.<br />
3. Marty Seligman in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743222970?v=glance">Authentic Happiness</a> glows about Mihaly and his work.<br />
