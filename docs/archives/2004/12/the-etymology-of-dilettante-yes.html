<h1>The Etymology of Dilettante ... yes.</h1>

<p>I love revealing etymologies.  The following is a sweet excerpt from Mihaly's book <a href="http://www.philosophistry.com/archives/2004/12/001163.html">Flow: the Psychology of Optimal Experience</a>:</p>

<blockquote>There are two words whose meanings reflect our somewhat warped attitudes toward levels of commitment to physical or mental activities.  These are the terms <i>amateur</i> and <i>dilettante</i>.  Nowadays these labels are slightly derogatory.  An amateur or a dilettante is someone not quite up to par, a person not to be taken very seriously, one whose performance falls short of professional standards.  But originally, "amateur," from the Latin verb <i>amare</i>, "to love," referred to a person who loved what he was doing.  Similarly a "dilettante," from the Latin <i>delectare</i>, "to find delight in," was someone who enjoyed a given activity.  The earliest meanings of these words therefore drew attention to experiences rather than accomplishments; they described the subjective rewards individuals gained from doing things, instead of focusing on how well they were achieving.  Nothing illustrates as clearly our changing attitudes toward the value of experience as the fate of these two words.  There was a time when it was admirable to be an amateur poet or a dilettante scientist, because it meant that the quality of life could be improved by engaging in such activities.  But increasingly the emphasis has been to value behavior over subjective states; what is admired is success, achievement, the quality of performance rather than the quality of experience.  Consequently it has become embarrassing to be called a dilettante, even though to be a dilettante is to achieve what counts most&mdash;the enjoyment one's actions provide. (Csikszentmihalyi 140)</blockquote>

<p>That summarizes nicely the gist of Philosophistry.<br />
