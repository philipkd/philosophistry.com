<h1>Random thoughts on homophobia and sexual dimorphism</h1>

<p>First some interesting quotes on sexuality:</p>

<p>"Homophobic?  Nah, you just heterophobic" - Marshall Mathers III (white rapper “Eminem”)</p>

<p>"In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation." - Simone de Beauvoir (French feminist and Sarte's love-buddy)</p>

<p>"Homosexuality in Russia is a crime and the punishment is seven years in prison, locked up with the other men. There is a three year waiting list." - Yakov Smirnoff (comedian)</p>

<p>Homophobia is some mixture of genetic, cultural, and personal/moral brew.</p>

<p>More brain-storming on the concept below...<br />

<br/>
<p>A possible explanation for its lack of presence in large cities and prevalence in rural areas is that open-sexuality is expedient for modern commerce.  By being open to the wide spectrum of gender, open-sexuality permits more people to work together. </p>

<p>The concept of gender differences in biology is under a more sophisticated umbrella concept of "sexual dimorphism."</p>

<p>When people introduced their dogs to me as a "she" or a "he," I would always have trouble grasping the concept.  In other words, there is not much sexual dimorphism in dogs.  Even most primates don't show great sexual dimorphism.  di-morph-ism  (different-shape-process).  Males and females generally look the same.</p>

<p>Then, isn't homophobia (the fear of homosexuals and homosexuality) also a fear of losing sexual dimorphism.</p>

<p>Common mental justifications of the homophobic:</p>

<p>"If girls dress like boys and boys dress like girls, then how are we to tell the difference?"</p>

<p>"Who then becomes the man of the household?"</p>

<p>Nobody really thinks about their underlying beliefs with regard to homosexuality.  Cosmopolitan people feel "enlightened" by their notions of open-sexuality when really it is largely inculcated by their metro or college-upbringing.  Fundamentalists feel "moral" by being homophobic when their opinions are also instructed by culture: religion.</p>

<p>Genetically and biologically, compared to other animals, humans are extremely sexually dimorphic.  A teleological fallacy (a type of thinking that assumes an underlying "motive") could take it to mean that we are "designed" to be heterosexual.</p>

<p>However, culturally, it can also be our "design" to trump rigid heterosexuality.</p>

<p>What is playing out in the clash of cultures is a tension between homophobia and open-sexuality.  So far, both forms are prevalent in cultures across the world.  Probably, homophobia is more common worldwide, while as open-sexuality is more common in developed nations.</p>

<p>There are parties on both sides, and where they meet there is tension.  Nobody knows why they have this conflict and both sides feel like they are on the side that is "right."</p></MTIfNotEmpty><h2>Comments</h2><p>Kaiulani said on May 15, 2004 10:42 AM: <p>Thinking hurts my brain.  It's like writing something.  After you enter into dispair trying to describe something, then put the pieces together, it comes together, and you fall apart.  After 41 years of trying to understand my homosexuality, I still can't do it.  I'm out to most of my family.  I've been with the same partner for 10 years, although we don't have sex, nor sleep in the same bed.  He's become more of a brother.  We are connected, but we don't share that intamacy.  </p>

<p>Convenience keeps us together.  And will probably keep us together until death do us part.  Who wants to journey through learning the intricacy's of anothers personality, and soul?  The first 3 years is all discovery.  The second 3 years is all adjustment.  The third 3 years is all tolerance. </p>

<p>It never comes together, though.  Parents still try to put a wedge in something they don't understand.  They purport support for being forward thinking.  After the economy tanked, my parents offered me a place to live without him, and his offered him a place to live without me.  </p>

<p>If by virtue of opposite genitalia, we'd both be invited to live with either parent without stipulation which follows your homophobia theory.<br />
Even the most forward thinkers think from behind.  Unless you are sinking in the thick of it, regardless of how above board your portend, it's over your head.</p>

<p>Will society ever accept us?  Sure. Not without attachments.  Most people that know us love us.  We've changed minds, and preconceptions.  We've turned heads.  Have we made any headway?  Nope.  We still find those with whose minds we changed regress to defending the credibility of their side which is essential in understanding sexual orientation.  It's all about what side your're on.</p>

<p>It's not about being attracted to the same sex, it's about defence, and offence.  Left, or right. Up, or down.  If you're attracted to the opposite sex, but support same sex, you're on their side, hence, a homo.   </p></p>
