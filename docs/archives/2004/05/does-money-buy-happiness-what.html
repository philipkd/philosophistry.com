<h1>Does money buy happiness?  What about good health?</h1>

<p><i>More goodies from Seligman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743222989/qid=1083624811/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-8313019-7710231?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Authentic Happiness</a></i></p>

<p>H = S + C + V</p>

<p>H: your enduring level of happiness<br />
S: your set range<br />
C: circumstances of your life<br />
V: factors under your voluntary control</p>

<p>This post focuses on C, circumstances such as religion, wealth, health etc.. and it's impact on your happiness.<br />

<br/>
<p>Seligman, the once-president of the American Psychological Association, has surveyed the surveys and this is a summary:</p>

<p><blockqouote><br />
If you want to lastingly raise your level of happiness by changing the external circumstances of your life, you should do the following:<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Live in a wealthy democracy, not in an impoverished dictatorship (a strong effect)<br />
<li>Get married (a robust effect, but perhaps not causal)<br />
<li>Avoid negative events and negative emotion (only a moderate effect)<br />
<li>Acquire a rich social network (a robust effect, but perhaps not causal)<br />
<li>Get a religion (a moderate effect)<br />
</ol><br />
As far as happiness and life satisfaction are concerned, however, you needn't bother to do the following:<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Make more money (money has little or not effect once you are comfortable enough to buy this book, and more materialistic people are less happy)<br />
<li>Stay healthy (subjective health, not objective health matters)<br />
<li>Get as much education as possible (no effect)<br />
<li>Change your race or move to a sunnier climate (no effect)<br />
</ol><br />
...<br />
Together, circumstances account for no more than between 8 and 15 percent of the variance in happiness.<br />

<p>If you are skeptical, please read the book before passing judgment, it's in your best interests.</p></MTIfNotEmpty>
