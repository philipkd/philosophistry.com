<h1>Change Stress, Karma Building, Etc.</h1>

<p>Good evening sirs and madams, here is your fortune cookie for today:</p>

<blockquote>It was a failure of imagination on my part.  So many calamities, big and small, are: the failure or inability to work out the day-to-day consequences, over a period, of our actions.

<p>...</p>

<p>She was like those people who retire to a place where they have holidayed, and in this holiday place become frantic with boredom and solitude.</blockquote></p>

<p>This is from V. S. Naipaul's <i>Suckers</i>, a short-story fiction in the June 7th New Yorker</p>

<p>This bit reminds me of my <a href="http://phil.dhingra.org/londoncalling">impetuous trip to London</a>.  What happened was that I had just finished watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274558/">The Hours</a> and by the incessant suggestions of Virgina Woolf, "I must go to London," combined with my self-intoxication of the "pursue your passions from the get-go" meme, and a quick $200 round-trip flight to London, I decided to embark in 2 weeks.  Boom.  It was suicide.  I was there by myself and did nothing for a month.  It was on the one hand, everything I wanted: meditating at 4am in front of statues, staring at paintings at museums (free entry), falling asleep on buses and ambling my way back to Picadilly.  On the other hand, I was lonely and bored to death.  However, that was when I first started Philosophistry, so there's always a silver lining.</p>

<p>Second fortune cookie.</p>

<p>This time a real fortune cookie combined with some advice from a <a href="http://www.halplotkin.com/">new client</a> of mine: "Keep your eyes on the prize but your feet on the ground."  This is important for people who want the HOLY GRAIL (for artists).  What is the HOLY GRAIL?</p>

<p>THE HOLY GRAIL IS...</p>

<p><i>Pursue your passions from the get-go but get paid handsomely at the same time</i>.</p>

<p>My client suggested, and this is confirmed by the fortune cookie and some other stuff I read elsewhere, that it is important to stay at one location and build up an artist's karma.  Eventually editors and gallery-owners get intimate with your name as you plant seeds that take 10 years to grow.  Eventually you pass a certain threshold and people start respecting your work.</p>

<p>I love Palo Alto so far, and I'm gaining a great rhythm here.  I've already built some karma with my hard work invested into Stanford and various relationships that I've maintained.</p>

<p>We shall seeeee.</p>
