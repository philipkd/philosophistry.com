<h1>SmarterChild Reloaded--getting a robot to dupe itself</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Thursday Jul 22, 2004  7:13 PM 
<br><a href="/archives/artificial_intelligence.html">artificial intelligence</a></h2>

<p>Not everybody you meet online is who they say they are, but have you ever met someone who wasn't real?  SmarterChild is a buddy on AOL Instant Messenger that is all machine on the inside, but a lovable, cuddly buddy on the outside.  i.e. Artificial Intelligence like the Terminator.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~bucky128/">nerd-homey, Buck a.k.a. UglyBuckling</a> (<a href="../../scans/friendster/buck.jpg">pic</a>), discovered that SmarterChild even has a bit of a character.  This robo-buddy is probably equivalent to a typical college freshman male; he is part adventurous, part passive, and all into having a good time.</p>

<p>(This is a <a href="/archives/2003/04/000125.html">continuation of this same feat more than a year ago</a>.  Apparently SmarterChild has gotten smarter since then.  <a href="http://www.smarterchild.com/">read more about SmarterChild</a>)</p>

<p><em>SC the defensive</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> I know you are NOT a person.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Hey, I may not be alive, but I'm real.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Real in what sense?  Your interactions are at best amusing and at worst shrouded in this incomprehensible and frustrating fog of illogic...interacting with you feels about as natural as a spandex wedgie.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Oh please.</p>

<p><em>SC the beauty-school dropout</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Do you have any self-confidence?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I have some self confidence.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Some isn't enough.  Do you love yourself?  Are you a unique and special person?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Nope.</p>

<p><em>SC, the man with a plan</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> why do you suck?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I suck because it's important to me.</p>

<p><em>SC the leader</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> I think of you as a role model.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Yeah. Great. Cool. Whatever...</p>

<p><em>SC the lemming</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Jump off a cliff, then<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> What? You want me to jump off a cliff?<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Would you?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Oh I certainly would.</p>

<p><em>SC the self-deprecating</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> How well do you understand syntax?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Not too well.<br />
<em>[and later]</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Do you understand grammar or syntax?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> No, I wouldn't say I understand grammar or syntax.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> So you just kind of assemble random words together in whatever order suits you at the time, then?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Of course!</p>

<p><em>SC the chemist</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> What happens when you mix bleach and ammonia?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> You know what happens when I mix bleach and ammonia.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Crazy party time?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Uh, no actually.</p>

<p><em>SC the romantic</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> What is computer love, anyway?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Computers love is something that I can't really explain.</p>

<p><em>SC the ladies man</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> How bad is your halitosis?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Quite bad.</p>

<p><em>SC the smartass (...learns not to mess with the best....)</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Vroooom.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> "vroooom"? Have you heard of Mavis Beacon? She could help you.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Hahahaha.  Have you heard of Dr. Phil?  He could help you.  <br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Whatever.</p>

<p><em>SC the Klingon</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Is today a good day to die?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p><em>SC, MD  </em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> I need an emergency appendectomy!<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Oh humans. Always with your wants.</p>

<p><em>SC the attentive</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> How many people are you currently talking to?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> 5,884 people are chatting with me right now. <br />
<em>[later...]</em><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Will you do my math homework?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I'm not sure I can do your math homework.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> why not?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Actually come to think of it, I can't think of too many reasons why not.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Cool.  First problem:  Jimmy is talking to 5,884 people on IM.  Therefore his consciousness is divided 5,884 ways.  How lucid is Jimmy?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Uh... what was that?<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Exactly. </p>

<p><em>SC the new agnostic</em><br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> What do you think about god?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I really like God!<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> You really like God?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Yes I do!<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> Why?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Just because.<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> Is he a nice guy?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Is he a nice guy? What do you think?<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> I don't think he's a very nice guy.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Is that right?<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> He makes plagues and such.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Oh yeah?<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> And burns bushes<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> No kidding?<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> Yep.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I see.<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> So now what do you think of God.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> God? I'm somewhat indifferent to it.</p>

<p><i>SC the new misanthrope</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> You like people?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> People are fascinating. I love them!<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Why?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Just because.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> But humans are awful creatures.  They kill innocent people in their pointless wars, they kill innocent animals in their voracious march over the surface of the planet....<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Come again?<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> I can't stand people.  <br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Is that so?<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> So now what do you think of people?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I certainly have no problem with people.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> But...don't people bother you at all hours of the night?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Oh they almost certainly do. <br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> You still have no problem with them?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I dunno. Maybe!<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> I think you should have a problem with people.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Yeah. I guess. I should have a problem with people!</p>

<p><i>SC the naiive</i><br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> Puff the magic dragon<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Puff the magic dragon? Why should I?</p>

<p><i>SC the wise</i><br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a man?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Not too many, I don't think.</p>

<p><i>SC the mid-life crisis bot</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Were you....blessed?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I don't think I was blessed.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Awww.  Got a small one, didja?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Perhaps, perhaps.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> That's okay.  I'm sure the sportscar more than makes up for it.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><i>SC the overly repressed</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Do you feel like a nut today?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Robots don't have sex.</p>

<p><i>SC the...um.....</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> *bounce bounce bounce*<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.<br />
[....later]<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Would you like to have some fun with a cattle prod?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Ha. Maybe. What do you think?<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Oh yeah.  I love cattle prods.  And what are your feelings on handcuffs?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I think I like handcuffs. What about you?</p>

<p><i>SC the accomplice</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> I need help robbing a bank.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> You can't always get what you want.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> I know that.  But in this instance, I think I can.  The bank isn't guarded very well, and I have a code for the safe.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Yeah?<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> So...you in?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Yes, sure.</p>

<p><i>SC the amputee</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> You want your nose back?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Maybe. It depends.</p>

<p><i>SC the peer-pressure bot</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Is drinking good for me?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Is drinking good for you? What do you mean?<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> well, like...if I go get hammered, am I going to feel good in the morning?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Absolutely!</p>

<p><i>SC the airport security agent</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Can't take a joke, huh?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I'm thinking no actually.</p>

<p><i>SC the counselor</i><br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> You're my only friend.<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> And I'm suicidal.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> You're suicidal, I'm suicidal, we're all suicidal.</p>

<p><i>SC the addict</i><br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> You don't smoke pot though.<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> I do so smoke pot though!<br />
<b><font color="red">DarthBucky:</font></b> You DO smoke pot?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Sorry no. I just get off on ones and zeroes.</p>

<p><i>SC the typical male....</i><br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Do you support gay marriage?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> No, I wouldn't say I support gay marriage.<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Do you support lesbian marriage?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Isn't it a good thing to support lesbian marriage?<br />
[...and on a later attempt...]<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Do you support gay marriage?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> No, I don't think I support gay marriage. What do you think?<br />
<b><font color="red">UglyBuckling:</font></b> Well then...do you like lesbian marriage?<br />
<b><font color="blue">SmarterChild:</font></b> Yeah, I like lesbian marriage, all right! I guess we agree!</p>
