<h1>The Secret of History</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Sunday Aug 15, 2004  7:08 PM 
<br><a href="/archives/leary_timothy.html">Leary, Timothy</a></h2>

<p>Below is a world-flipper of a quote in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0874778700/102-2977983-8825768?v=glance">Timothy Leary's Autobiography</a></p>

<p>But first, some introductions...</p>

<p>Timothy Leary - Harvard psychologist who kick-started the psychedelic 60s by going around the country "turning on" the intellectual elite in the hopes of passing chemical wisdom into the mainstream.</p>

<p>Neal Cassady - inspiration for the Beat Movement, and friends with Jack Keroac, Ken Kesey, and Allen Ginsberg.  You can read more about the <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/speccol/exhibits/sixties/kesey.html">Psychedelic 60s and more here</a></p>

<p>December 1960, Leary invites Cassady to his house to play with drugs.  They are chatting it up, and Leary, a novice drug user (compared to Cassady), is describing his challenges.</p>

<p><font size="+2">Timothy Leary</font><br />

said:<blockquote>We're doing our best.  We've read everything that's been written in the last four thousand years on the subject.<br />
</blockquote><br />
<br /><br />
<font size="+2">Neal Cassady</font><br />
<img src="../../scans/2004/08/cassady.jpg"><br />
responds in his habitual western accent:<blockquote>You're cracking me up, man.  There are no books written by scientists about ecstasy and cosmic orgasms.  it's oral history and poetry.  <i>The history books are about meaningless public events like wars and elections and revolutions.</i> (emphasis added)  The only important things happen in the bodies and brains of individuals, you understand.  That's the great secret of human life that scientists never talk about.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>to which Timothy Leary responds, "Is that right."</p>

<p>(Page 52)</p>

<p>Man, that is great!  It did a 180 on my perspective on the world.  </p>

<p>Such an ugly chunk of my brain is devoted to imitating the gloom laden in the 24/hour news and history books.  If you read history, if you watch the news, it feels like the world is this killer cannibal run by a cabal of sinisters.  But really, I bike, I laugh with friends, eat good food every day, life is in general good.</p>

<p>The inner story is the ultimate story.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2><p><a title="http://www.guy-named-matt.com" href="http://www.guy-named-matt.com" rel="nofollow">Matt</a> said on August 18, 2004  2:18 AM: <p>You have no idea how much I needed to read this at this particular moment of my life.</p>

<p>My father and I just recently got into the most horrific fight of our lives.  Well, except for the time he punched me.</p>

<p>It had everything to do with father/son jealousy, but on its surface, it began as an argument about politics.</p>

<p>I should know better.</p></p>
