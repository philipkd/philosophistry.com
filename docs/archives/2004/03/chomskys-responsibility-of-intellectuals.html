<h1>Chomsky's Responsibility of Intellectuals</h1>

<p>I was once taking three classes where during one week, Chomsky was cited in all three of them: (Cognitive, Political, and Computer Science).  Anyway, I was scavenging around the Internet and found this 1967 essay written by him particularly moving.<blockquote>TWENTY-YEARS AGO, Dwight Macdonald published a series of articles in Politics on the responsibility of peoples and, specifically, the responsibility of intellectuals. I read them as an undergraduate, in the years just after the war, and had occasion to read them again a few months ago. They seem to me to have lost none of their power or persuasiveness. Macdonald is concerned with the question of war guilt. He asks the question: To what extent were the German or Japanese people responsible for the atrocities committed by their governments? And, quite properly, he turns the question back to us: To what extent are the British or American people responsible for the vicious terror bombings of civilians, perfected as a technique of warfare by the Western democracies and reaching their culmination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, surely among the most unspeakable crimes in history. To an undergraduate in 1945-46—to anyone whose political and moral consciousness had been formed by the horrors of the 1930s, by the war in Ethiopia, the Russian purge, the "China Incident," the Spanish Civil War, the Nazi atrocities, the Western reaction to these events and, in part, complicity in them—these questions had particular significance and poignancy.</p>

<p>With respect to the responsibility of intellectuals, there are still other, equally disturbing questions. Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions. In the Western world, at least, they have the power that comes from political liberty, from access to information and freedom of expression. For a privileged minority, Western democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us. The responsibilities of intellectuals, then, are much deeper than what Macdonald calls the "responsibility of people," given the unique privileges that intellectuals enjoy.</blockquote> (<a href="http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19670223.htm">view source</a>)</p>

<p>Ten years from now my generation will begin inheriting the Earth, and then I'll have to ask myself, to what page of history do I attribute my work?</p>

<p>Or I can just be the nihilist-epicurean whatever, sip on some cocktails, and philosophistricize into the sunset, in which case <i>that</i> will be my tribute.<br />
