<h1>Machiavelli, the 1500-era Blogger, Reveals a Cause for Intellectualism</h1>

<p>People pursue intellectual interests partly as a proxy for socialization.</p>

<p>This is apparent in an excerpt from this letter from Niccolo Machiavelli written in 1513.</p>

<blockquote>When evening comes, I return home and enter my study; on the threshold I take off my workday clothes, covered with mud and dirt, and put on the garments of court and palace. Fitted out appropriately, I step inside the venerable courts of the ancients, where, solicitously received by them, I nourish myself on that food that alone is mine and for which I was born; where I am unashamed to converse with them and to question them about the motives for their actions, and they, out of their human kindness, answer me. (<a href="http://130.238.50.3/ilmh/Ren/flor-mach-lett-vettori.htm">View Source</a>)</blockquote>

<br/>
<p><a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/000006.html">Brad DeLong describes with more flourish the nature of this intellectualism-as-socialization concept</a>.  I particularly like his use of imagery: "Moreover, people's rough edges are filed off in their books. Adam Smith found Jean-Jacques Rousseau impossible in person, but that chunk of Rousseau's mind that is instantiated in the hardware-and-software combination of Gutenberg Information Technology is very pleasant company."</p>

<p>I became curious about this issue when I thought for a moment, "what if I lost my intellectual interest?"  In the past three weeks I have been avoiding deep, complicated texts in exchange for humor, movies, and visually-rich websites.  I also have been under a process of strongly forced self-transformation.  One of the side-effects of this lunge may be that I lose a lot of the angst that drove me to complicated theory.</p>

<p>I've been refreshing my favorite intellectual websites and blogs, hundreds of times, only to close them uninterested.  Are my interests shifting?  Where will my interests go?  I picked up my old hand-written notepad journals and started diarying by pen again, something I haven't done in two years.  While I haven't given up blogging, I'm becoming less like an alarmist Nietzsche with a lantern, and more of a calm, declaratory pseudo-intellectual cum entertainer.</p>

<p>I pondered the question, "what are the negative motivations for intellectualism" possibly because I wanted to feel like I was progressing away from intellectualism, and not regressing.  This is healthy as I change, though, so that I don't lament my former traits as I lose them.</p>
