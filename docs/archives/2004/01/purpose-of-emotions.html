<h1>Purpose of Emotions</h1>

<p>What is the purpose of emotions?</p>

<p>A quick response from what seems to be the standard psych answer:</p>

<p>That emotions "serve the useful purpose of letting us know what's going on and motivating us to take some form of action" (<a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/femoclear53380frm9.showMessage?topicID=366.topic>link</a>).</p>

<p>I'm in agreement with this, that emotions are there primarily to alert and to motivate.  Its etymological roots are excite and move.<br />

<br/>
<p>Awareness<br />
Motivation</p>

<p>are the big ones.</p>

<p>Another one mentioned <a href=http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/emotion_purpose.htm>here</a> is that of a "social signal."  Emotions help us communicate to others our state, helping them to adjust themselves to how we feel.  They also mentioned it helps us weigh outcomes.</p>

<p>So, the big 4:<br />
Awareness, Motivation, Communication, Decision-Making (Thank you Go(d)ogle)</p>

<p>NOW</p>

<p>In any definition of something, it's important to look at the NEGATIVE SPACE.  So what are emotions NOT good for....</p>

<p>Well, for one.  Emotions cannot tell you the truth about something.  A rational analysis of the evidence can tell you what's right and wrong.  Emotions will bias you, and leads to things like faith.</p>

<p>Emotions cannot fix your problems.  Free will can.  You can't anger something to a solution.  One could argue that motivating is a principle agent of action, and emotions create motivation.  However, emotion must be combined with a desire to act in order to become motivation.  If, for example, you have a victim's mentality, you don't place as much importance or responsibility on your own actions.  You may feel a strong pain or desire, but may not think to get up and act on it.  You may sit and stew, but not necessarily come up with a plan of action.</p>

<p>And even then, once you have the motivation, you have to have to actually carry it through.  You have to send the signals to your muscles and move.</p>

<p>So yeah, that's emotions.</p>

<p>What it does:<br />
- draws your attention<br />
- motivates<br />
- communicates<br />
- colors your decisions</p>

<p>What it doesn't do:<br />
- reveal the truth<br />
- solve your problems</p></MTIfNotEmpty>
