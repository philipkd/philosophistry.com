<h1>Emotional Aliens Among Us!  Neon Green ALERT!</h1>

<p>How many aliens are among us?</p>

<p>How many humans, while having the visual appearances of standard humans, have an alien, inner-human?</p>

<p>Fortunately, we do have a definition for the "standard" human.  Psychologists have come up with <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~gwynne/maslow.HTM">Maslow's Ladder of 5 Basic Needs</a> and a list of 5 Basic Emotions: guilt, hate, shame, revenge, love (<a href="http://mlcami.netian.com/Movie%20Script%20-%205%20(V.S).htm">Source</a>).</p>

<p>However, there must be human emotions and needs that are unnamed and even undiscovered.  For I'm skeptical that all these 6 billion humans only have combinations of these short five generalities.<br />

<br/>
<p>My recent observations on people have also given me hope that there is an emotional frontier unexplored within ourselves.</p>

<p>Today I was walking through campus during 11AM rush-hour.  As I was walking near people, I picked someone out and got a good look at their face.  After I passed them by, I then mimicked their expression.  Simulating their physical mannerisms also simulated their mood.  After my emotions were in sync with my target's, I then tried to label what I was feeling.</p>

<p>After a few attempts, labelling became difficult.  The mannerisms I was mimicking and the subsequent feelings I had were foreign to me.  I frequently felt this when mimicking girls.  The only way I can describe their emotions is as a "floaty sense of tripping over daisies combined with hope, earnestness, and desperation."  I can't relate what I was feeling to any previous experience.</p>

<p>I then ceased trying to describe how I felt; my words and their associated connotations were ruining my observations.  I tried, instead, to really feel <i>feel</i> their emotions.  Instead of simply observing joy, which is just three letters, j-o-y, I tried to traverse the continuous mountain of information packed into the feeling itself.</p>

<p>After walking for five minutes with this perspective, I got the sense that the landscape of emotions out there is diverse and unlike what I've encountered personally.  <b>5 Basic Emotions</b> and <b>5 Basic Needs</b> felt like an insult to the richness of our inner architecture.</p>

<p>If I were to continue doing this in earnest, my hunch is that I would discover aliens among humans.  I would find emotional creatures living inside us as diverse and as strange as the animal kingdom.  And when I stumble upon these unfamiliars, the Philosophist will have his fun.</p></MTIfNotEmpty>
