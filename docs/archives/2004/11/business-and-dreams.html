<h1>Business and Dreams</h1>

<p>Some business observations came to me from a dream I had...</p>

<p>In this dream, I was a short 9-year-old, following behind a jester who had holes in his pockets.  As he galloped about, coins sprinkled from his pants into the grooves of the turgid road.  The coins were colored in such a way, and landed in such a way, that combined with the road they formed a slick surface.  The coins became invisible in their arrangements.  But then, a taller, wiser man cavorted about and stopped by the road.  Because of his keen eyes, he saw the coins, and so he scooped them up and galloped along merrily as well.</p>

<p>Thusly I formed two conclusions:</p>

<p>1) Billions of dollars are flowing all around me, many into sinks not proportional to hours-worked, value-of-product, experience-of-worker, nor social-utility, but merely the result of the jester of capitalism jiggling.</p>

<p>2) If a billionaire lost all his money, he wouldn't be poor for long.  This may have a lot to do with the contacts he still has.  But, let's say he loses all his friends, I'm certain he still would become rich in a short period of time.  This can only mean that a special knack for opportunity has grown within him.  The invisible coins in the dirt road may become resplendent to his magic eyes.  (The exception to this are the rich who haven't earned it.)</p>

<p>What is this magic eye?  I'm not sure.  But a sampling of this could be, for example, the ability to size up others accurately.  You may know someone who has a terribly brilliant idea and The Right Stuff, but lacks someone who believes in him.  If you are more certain about his success than he is, you can offer him $5,000 for 10% of whatever he makes from the idea, and then guide him to millions.<br />
