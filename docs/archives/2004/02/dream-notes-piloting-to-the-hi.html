<h1>Dream Notes: Piloting to the Himalayas</h1>

<p><i>Lucid dreams are dreams where you are aware that you are dreaming.  Below is a journal entry about a recent weak lucid dream.  More lucid dreaming information can be found in my <a href="/archives/lucid_dreaming.html">Lucid Dreaming Archives</a> or from the <a href="http://www.lucidity.com/">Lucidity Institute</a></i></p>

<p>I was half-awake, half-asleep for a noon nap, and I was fading in and out reality.  I became aware of this, and so I tried controlling my dream.<br />

<br/>
<p>First I glanced to the side of my bay window outside and onto the pavement by the construction site.  There, the pavement floor transformed into what looked like a mosaic of broken glass designs.  This was inconsistent with what the floor was in reality, and so I knew I was dreaming.</p>

<p>Then I embarked on imagining things.  The first thought in my mind was that I was a fighter pilot, as I was sitting in a chair with my head against a wall while I was napping.  This thought prompted a flight into the mountains.  I went through gray cloud upon grey cloud, until I reached the apex of the mountain.  Then around the side of the mountain, a cliff opened up like a doorway that led into a wooden enclosure.  Inside was sand and dirt, which bored me.  I left and curved around to the other the side of the mountain, until I imagined another more interesting destination, a harem room with couch and lady.  She never materialized as I was about to wake up at this point.  The scene switched back and forth between my dream state and my bedroom.</p>

<p>I gave up and then the dream scene faded to black.  That's when I knew I was coming off.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Lesson:</p>

<p>After having done about ten lucid dreams that lasted less than a couple of seconds, I have learnt to remain calm upon discovering lucidity.  In the previous times where I was anxious to do play around, my mind became alert and soon I was back into the real world.  This time around, since the novesty of lucid dreaming has worn a bit, I gradually eased my way into dream control.</p>

<p>The nap lasted about ten minutes, but the experience felt like thirty.</p></MTIfNotEmpty><h2>Comments</h2><p>Bao said on February 29, 2004  5:24 AM: <p>Your website is EXPLODING. </p></p>

Now I can control my dreams like most people wish they could. No more worrying about waking up, or not becoming lucid in the dream. I didn't know anyone else experienced lucid dreams until i found your website a while ago. I thought i was just crazy. Keep training my friend. It all pays off in the end. When you think you're getting too excited, hold your arms out and spin in circles while taking deep breaths. If all goes well, you'll no longer worry about waking up. </p>

<p>Love the website though. Check out mine if you get bored sometime.</p></p>
