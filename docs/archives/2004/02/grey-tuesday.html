<h1>Grey Tuesday!!</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.greytuesday.org/">Grey Tuesday</a> - is an online protest of EMI's efforts to deep-6 creativity, and I'm participatin!</p>

<p>Succinct summary of the argument: philosophistry "is grey today because I believe that musical sampling without prior consent of the copyright holder should be legally allowed because it does our society more good than harm." (<a href="http://www.kotke.org/">credit</a>)</p>

<p>Here are the mp3s of DJ Danger Mouse's Grey Album to show my support of this one-of-a-kind protest.  (Read my discussion of the album here).</p>

<p><strike><ol><br />

<li>Moment of Clarity<br />
<li>Change Clothes<br />
<li>Allure<br />
<li>Justify My Thug<br />
<li>Interlude<br />

<p>Why am I doing this? What's the Philosophistric angle to this article?</p>

<p>I have no idea why I am doing this.  I'm a memeplex, I'm young, I feel a little rebellious, I like the album, I don't want to miss the party, I have an affinity for Internet "ideals," and I guess its the thrill of danger.  Sure I agree with the idea behind this, sorta--I didn't really sit down and analyze intellectual property right laws.  But ultimately, I have to admit, that this is driven by mysterious hormones</p>

<p>I did receive a cease and decist letter from EMI's lawyers, demanding I don't post this article, and threatening that I pay for losses.  This could turn out to be one of the most irrational things I've done, or a nice glimmering moment to reflect on when I age.  I once was threatened to be sued for $10 million when I was 14, and my cousin's currently fighting the FTC.  Oi, it runs in the family.  Here goes nothing.</p>

<p>(Not completely irrational... this posting complies with <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html">Title 17, Chapter 1, Sec. 107</a> of "Fair use" laws governing reproduction of copyrighted material: (1) this album is for the non-profit education of the people, word!, (3) this is a remix album, and so does not consume enough of the offending material, and (4) there is no market for this album, so there is no impact.)<br />
