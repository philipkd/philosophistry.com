<h1>Hope for the Democrats: Bush fumbles interview</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Monday Feb  9, 2004  8:31 AM 
</h2>

<p>The headline is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4209283/">Bush defends service record in NBC interview</a>.  They should modify the headline by inserting the word "try" before defends.</p>

<p>Bush did a poor job in the interview.  He stuttered, fumbled, and was overall insecure.  While in general Bush's elocution is poor, he did poor relative to himself: he looked visibly stressed and thrown off by the questioning.</p>

<p>When I saw this I felt a surge of hope for the Democrats in 2004.  Tim Russert put up a quote from Kerry:<br />
<blockquote><b>Russert:</b> This is what John Kerry had to say last year.  He said that his colleagues are appalled at the quote "President's lack of knowledge.  They've managed him the same way they've managed Ronald Reagan.  They send him out to the press for one event a day.  They put him in a brown jacket and jeans and get him to move some hay or move a truck, and all of a sudden he's the Marlboro Man.  I know this guy.  He was two years behind me at Yale.  I knew him, and he's still the same guy."</blockquote><br />
LOL.  When Russert put up this quote, given the context of the hard--yet respectable--drilling of the President, the moment was like Emeril Lagasse doing a "bam" and kickin' things up a notch.</p>

<p>To those that felt Bush's re-election was certified by Saddam's detention should look no further than this interview to understand that things do change.<br />
