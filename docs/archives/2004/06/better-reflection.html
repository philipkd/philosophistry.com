<h1>Better Reflection</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Saturday Jun 26, 2004 12:45 PM

<p>There are two ways to improve self-reflection.  One is meta-reflection.  The other is structured reflection.</p>

<p>Meta-reflection's interesting.</p>

<p>Once you reflect, ask yourself, "What does the nature of my reflection say about me?"  Try to interpret your reflections like you would interpret another author's book.  What is the subtext?  Why am I thinking this way now?</p>

<p>I often find that my reflections are not quality introspections.  True introspection requires that you put yourself at a distance from yourself.  Step away and see who you from a third person.</p>

<p>I used to do an exercise where I'd try to imagine myself as a fly on the wall, looking at myself, and pondering what I think about how I am doing.</p>

<p>Structured reflection.</p>

<p>Usually when I reflect, I just spit out whatever's on my mind.  An alternative approach is to ask certain questions or cover certain bases.  How happy was I this week?  Is my reflection honest?  What does my heart say?  What does my mind say?  Is there anything I'm missing?  <a href="http://www.creativethink.com/">Refresh this page (Creative Whack Pack)</a> and that should generate other good questions.</p>

<p>Another good source for reflection ideas is to peruse <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/">Aesop's Fables</a>.<br />
<h2>Comments</h2><p>neommox said on July  2, 2004  6:07 AM: <p>I think the best reflection comes from continually(sp) questioning everything . That is to say always ask why and how no matter what the subject and no matter how much you think you know of the subject. To always question thoughts, motives, and feelings within yourself is, in my opinion, the best way to understand yourself. You will, of course, always come to a question you can't fully answer but just knowing the question will lead to finding the answer much faster. The goal is understanding. Facts are useless until they have been connected to other facts, until they have been integrated into your wisdom. This produces understanding. With the increase in connections the "bigger picture" becomes more and more illuminated. All this questioning and connecting have lead me to understand the meaning of life and the meaning of the universe itself. The knowledge is everwhere simply waiting to be understood. <br />
Maybe I am just insane. Take it as you will.Just know that it all is going according to plan. It is getting better ever day. If nothing else i have planted more seeds. All will become clear soon. "Love is Free, Love Me, say Hell Yes" or something like that :) . Everything is Everything.</p></p>

We forget that the potential for new ideas is infinite.  Beyond every conclusion is an infra-conclusion, which has its own infra-conclusion, and so on ad infinitum.</p></p>
