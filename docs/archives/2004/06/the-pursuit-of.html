<h1>The Pursuit of Passion = Doing things for their own sake</h1>

<p>In order to effectively engage in an activity, you have to care about the activity for its own sake.</p>

<p>If you are working to make money, if you are writing a book to become famous, or if you are blogging because you want attention, then you will not truly squeeze the passion out of that process.</p>

<p>I learned this in 1997 when I entered a web design contest just to win.  I lost the competition, but I also wasted my time because I didn't learn any new skills nor did I enjoy what I was doing.  In 1998, I re-entered the same competition, but this time with the idea that I was doing it to learn and have a good time.  By the time I was finished with my project, I already felt satisfied, and because I was so passionate about the process, I ended up winning the contest anyways.</p>

<p>I think <a href="http://ryskamp.org/brain/">Bob Ryskamp</a> referred to this process as "autotelic," whereby you do the activity for "its own sake."  auto = self, telic = teleos end, result, but more like intent.</p>

<p>I came to this idea when I found myself unable to blog.  I realized that I was blogging for many other reasons, such as ego, but not for the activity's primary usage: to journal.  If I elect "to journal" as the prime motivation, then blogging will come more fluidly.</p>

<p>Is what you are doing, autotelic?<br />
<h2>Comments</h2><p><a title="http://ryskamp.org" href="http://ryskamp.org" rel="nofollow">Bob Ryskamp</a> said on June 28, 2004 11:31 PM: <p>It was "autotelic", a word I first noticed in the book Flow by Mihaly Csikzentmihalyi.</p>

<p>More on <a href="http://ryskamp.org/brain/personal/an-autotelic-new-year.html" rel="nofollow">my New Year's autotelic resolutions</a>.</p>

<p>My current hunch is that few things are naturally autotelic, but that the way you go about them can make almost anything so. With strict scheduling, goal-setting, and personal accountability (I know, sounds like fun), most things can be enjoyable. That's Mihaly's argument, anyway...</p></p>
