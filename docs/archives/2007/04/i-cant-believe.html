<h1>"I can't believe he's still blogging."</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Saturday Apr  7, 2007 12:26 AM

<p>It's been 4 years since I started blogging. There is more text written by me on this site than the comments by others. Clearly this is a one-way conversation. It's like this site is a logorrhea of questionable utility. You'd think I cared about efficiency and effectiveness, right? You'd think I'd have quit by now, right?</p>

<p>What keeps me going is that I have a long list of deep and compelling ideas, that I feel any amount of time can be justified in an attempt to communicate those ideas to the world. What you see on the site are attempts to at least encapsulate fragments, and see if I can get some kind of traction for them.</p>

<p>However, after those 4 years, I think I'm at somewhat of an impasse. There's two clear ways to get those ideas out there. One is to write fiction or film scripts. The other is to go academic and start researching.</p>

<p>Both those paths are really unnatural and uncomfortable for me, so I'm wondering if I just have to accept that these important observations are going to simply be private revelations.</p>

It looked like you intentionally disabled them. I guess that wasn't the case?</p>

<p>Blogging in the face of the anonymous internet is hard, it always amazes me that more people don't give up doing it.</p></p>
