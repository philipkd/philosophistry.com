<p>I was turned onto this insightful book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPathfinder-Choose-Lifetime-Satisfaction-Success%2Fdp%2F0684823993&tag=philosophistr-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Pathfinder: How to Choose or Change Your Career for a Lifetime of Satisfaction and Success</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=philosophistr-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>The best way to learn is just by doing. This is from page 16, Inquiry #2. Go over this list. Check the statements that are true. If you check almost all of them, you are doing pretty well. The ones you left unchecked show where you could use some improvement. If you left several of them unchecked, you are in the wrong career; and you are reading the right book.</p>

<p><input type="checkbox"> You feel like a duck in a pond. Your work is a natural expression of your talents and personality<br />
<input type="checkbox"> Your job fits you so well that, often work is play.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> You are proud of what you do and enjoy telling other people about it.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> You are highly respected at work because you are so good at what you do.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> You do not have to pretend to be someone else at work.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> Your own best and most natural forms of creative expression are what you are paid to do.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> The environment you work in brings out your best efforts.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> You enthusiastically look forward to going to work most of the time.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> Your job rewards your most important values and allows you to fulfill your goals in terms of personal growth, achievement, income, stability, etc.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> The result of your efforts makes a contribution that personally matters to you. You don't spend your days working for something that you don't really care about.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> Your job directly fulfills your work-related goals. It does not create barriers to realizing your other goals.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> You like the people you work with.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> You are on a winning team that is having a great time getting the job done.<br />
<input type="checkbox"> A day on the job leaves you feeling energized, not burned out.</p>
