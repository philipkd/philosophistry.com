<h1>The simultaneously flattering, depressing, and ironic feeling of someone stealing your work</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Sunday Nov 11, 2007 12:55 AM

<p>So I'm flirting with the idea of making shirts (in a serious way) and so I devoted myself today to doing market research, which meant taking a keen eye to places like Urban Outfitters and the boutiques on South Congress since that's the kind of edgy-yet-sell-out-commercialized look I'm going for. It also just so happened that <a href="http://www.stitchaustin.com/">Stitch</a>, a fashion and crafts show with an emphasis on indie designers, was this weekend. So I decided to go, and there was area sponsored by <a href="http://www.carlorossi.com/">Carlo Rossi</a> where you could make your own shirts!</p>

<p>So I sat down and made this one:</p>

<p><img src="../../scans/2007/11/firstbab.jpg"></p>

<p>I hung it up to dry on a rack, and I left the area to go watch the fashion show. When I returned, it was gone! Someone had definitely stolen it as I asked the people cleaning up the booth, and they said the shirts were meant to be left there for the creators to pick their work back up. And I could see that the rack where I left my shirt was still semi-full with other shirts I had placed mine with.</p>

<p>So I was simultaneously hit with a feeling of sadness and flattery. My shirt, my <i>first</i> shirt</i>, was good enough to be stolen. At the same time, I really liked that shirt! And since the show's for indie designers, I might see my idea taken for a ride and appear in someone else's collection.</p>

<p>And yet, it's ironic&mdash;and this goes back to propaganda that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> has drilled into my head: that everything is derivative&mdash;because I can trace my steps precisely how I came to that shirt design:</p>

October 17, 2007 - some alums and I walked into the <a href="http://www.21cmuseumhotel.com/austin/">21c museum hotel</a> sales office after hours (theoretically, we were breaking in), and I snapped that photo above.</p>

<p><br />

November 2, 2007 - I went to <a href="http://blantonmuseum.org/experience_the_blanton/b_scene/index.cfm">Blanton's B Scene</a> and checked out the above photo in their amazing contemporary arts collection upstairs.</p>

<p><br />

November 11, 2007 - And finally, today, I was munching on a Gyro at Kismet Cafe on The Drag and saw what I think is a silhouette of Audrey Hepburn.</p>

<p><br />
And after writing this, I realize just how much of a propogandist I am for Austin, TX.</p>

<p>And no, I'm not as much of a narcissist as my blog's self-aggrandizement makes me out to be.</p>

I've tried to read his science fiction a couple of times!  We should talk about him sometime!  That's a great shirt!  You'll have to make me one when you get rollin!  We were talking about making shirts tonigh at rehearsal!  All in exclamation!</p></p>
