<h1>Another justification of "Philosophistry"</h1>

<p>To those who are upset at my indictment against many philosophers as being merely sophists, here's what I have to say</p>

<p>Mention the word philosophy to anybody on the street, and they'll tell you it's a complete waste of time. Philosophers are lost in their language syntax. Wittgenstein figured this out early on.</p>

<p>If a philosopher says, "time is not quite real" then he's an idiot.</p>

<p>But if he said, "Time-A is-B not-C quite-D real-E" and then defined his own variants of his usage of those words, then maybe I could take him seriously. Instead, everybody's just talking past each other. They're just good at creating really good hooks for each other to grapple onto.</p>

<p>I cannot take philosophy seriously enough because when you open a philosophy book or read a treatise, there's a stunning lack of charts, graphs, and formula. This is yet again, another reason I love Wittgenstein's Tractatus... has tons of formulae.</p>

<p><i>By the way, this is of course somewhat tongue-in-cheek. I love philosophy, but it's a very nuanced love.</i></p>

Keep up the interesting articles. It's always good to get a balance.</p></p>
