<h1>Giving up as a writer? maybe not yet...</h1>

<p>It's always good to talk to people going through similar things you are. Otherwise, after a while, you start to wonder, "how the hell did people get their direction straight given the infinite possibilities and uncertainty that accompanies the trek forward into adulthood."</p>

<p>Ian gave me an idea the other day...</p>

<p>I was expressing my frustrations about how</p>

<p>See, I tried to set out to write a novel once. Around Sept of 2004, three months after I graduated from college, I set out to just put pen-to-paper and make pages.. "crank that baby out."  So I said, okay, I'm going to write a fiction novel that encapsulates all my ideas. But as I was writing, I just grew frustrated. The first day that I tried, I put out ten pages, with lots of ideas, and it's a beautiful piece of work, except I had this knot in my stomach the whole time. And I couldn't pin it down. I even promised myself to keep going in the face of that, but by the third day, I was like, nah, this is over. It's that gut feeling, and I just threw up my hands.</p>

<p>I didn't give up within three days, just like that, though, and I kept writing down ideas. I did a lot of reading, and contemplated going into journalism.</p>

<p>So I was expressing, to Ian, who is also trying to set out and crank a novel out, at how I was just so bewildered by my writing situation. I've written so much on philosophistry. Mind you, both me and you are aware that a lot of it is junk, but I believe there's gems in there, in the interstices of it all. And there's a lot of passion + words that I think, somewhere, in the back of my mind, "just has to be turned into something for society."</p>

<p>So I told Ian, "dude, the reason I can't write a novel is because if I did, it'd be just filled with symbols, many blank pages, text all over the place, and mostly incomprehensible."</p>

<p>Then he said, "so what?"</p>

<p>That's all he said, but now it's got me thinking. Because, a lot of my favorite art pieces are medium-defying works. Yves' Klein's <i>IKB</i> and Edwin Abbott's <i>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions</i>. There's quite a bit of medium-defiant art-work actually. Another famous piece is John Cage's <i>4'33''</i> of silence. It's not great art to me, though, because it seems more novelty than anything. Or even more famously is Marcel Duchamp's <i>Fountain</i>. So there is some acceptability of really really weird art.</p>

<p>Maybe I always put myself too constrained, to write an straight-up fiction novel. Or to make an ordinary painting. But maybe that's not who I am as an artist. And maybe I always was hard on myself. See, I always admired Warhol because he was also a good classical-style painter, not just a whacko. So he had credibility with the artworld since to him, painting dripping clocks was a choice, not a cop-out due to a lack of a skill.</p>

<p>So, we'll see.</p>
