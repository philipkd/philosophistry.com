<h1>My observation at the end of An Inconvenient Truth</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Saturday Aug 26, 2006 10:17 AM

<p>The film <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> is so self-assured in its psychological impact that at the end of the film, it has a series of one-line imperatives to help the environment. It says, for example, in small white text, "ride a bike," and then it fades away. Then it says, "e-mail your congressman," and then it fades away. This part became like a mini-rally, and people waited around for it. This is surprising, because normally people get up when they hear the sprightly music and see the small white text at the end of a movie. Then the credits started to roll, and finally people got up.</p>

<p>The theater we were in happened to be right by the main parking lot, so everybody kind of moved together as a school of fish. One by one, they filtered from the sidewalk, over the curb, onto the asphalt, and on their way to their cars. However, I noticed an awkward yet somber silence. Apparently, I'm used to the concomitant wave of "doot-doot" sounds and headlights flashing. Here, though, nobody was pulling out their car keys to remotely unlock their vehicles.</p>

<p>We continued to filter through the parking lot, negotiating through the cars already there, still in total silence. There were couples walking together, and they weren't talking either. I became a bit nervous and walked swiftly to my car, only unlocking it right when I was up against the side door. Then I slipped in and drove off.</p>

<p>The film, at least for a moment, made it really uncool to own a car.</p>
