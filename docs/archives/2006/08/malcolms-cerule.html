<h1>"Malcolm's Cerulean Dusk" - Rothkoization short story bit  no. 1</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Thursday Aug 17, 2006 10:18 PM

<p><i>I may or may not be trying to publish a fictional short story soon. I've tried to become a more serious writer in the past, so this would be the umpteenth attempt at it. The following is a fragment from this potential short story. The story centers around Malcolm who experiences some kind of synesthesia where colors directly affect his emotions. Some of the themes have originated from a couple previous blog posts, including <a href="/archives/2006/05/rothkoization.html">one in May 2006</a> and <a href="http://www.futurehi.net/archives/000239.html">another in July 2004</a>.</i></p>

<p>It's an afternoon on November 16th, one week before Thanksgiving, and Malcolm is getting nervous. The sunsets are getting earlier, earlier than when he leaves work at 6:00pm. The problems begin once the sun is fully set, and the dark orange afterglow dims away.</p>

<p>Malcolm is phoning Jennifer on the way outside, and explains, "For a few minutes, the world becomes a cruel cerulean. There are some shadows from the almost-faded afterglow, which buffs the already blue-ish purple into cerulean."</p>

<p>"Why don't I just pick you up?"</p>

<p>"It's okay. The only change, really, is that I have to take a long way home that doesn't have trees and keeps me faced toward the dark amber part of the sky."</p>

<p>"How long have you been doing this?"</p>

<p>"What? Taking the long way? Not until I had my own car. Before then, I just tried to wear a hat and sunglasses to hide the crying."</p>
