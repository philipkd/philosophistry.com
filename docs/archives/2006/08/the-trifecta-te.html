<h1>How playing video games all day affects my visual field (The Trifecta Tetris Effect)</h1>

<p>The Tetris effect is the observed feeling of people who play Tetris for hours and hours, and then start dreaming of falling blocks as they go to bed.</p>

<p>So, being a video game tester, you can imagine the kind of Tetris effect I get. I've been on the same game for two months now, playing it, for the most part, day-in and day-out. Usually when we "play" the game, it's to do a stress test. A stress test involves picking out a component of the game, and just butchering it to death. For example, The Guild 2 has a political system, which involves running for office. I can't count how many times in a given day, one person on our team says some permutation of the following sentence to the other: "did you get office?"</p>

<p>When we went out to lunch today, someone briefly talked about the US political system, about mid-term elections, and who is going to get office, and the Tetris effect came over me. I immediately started seeing the buttons and screens of the game, and saw Joe Lieberman trying to right-click his way into the office of President. My visual field partly turned into a video game, as if I were experiencing deja vu.</p>

<p>Working in QA, there's actually three layers of a Tetris effect at play. First, there's the natural effect that any video game has&mdash;almost every video game is about endless repetition with slight variation until mastery. The second layer is the stress testing I mentioned above.  The third layer is the way that video game testing interacts with the repetitiveness of office conversations. At Aspyr, we have the catch-phrase "bug it" or "put it in the database" as an imperative to file a report about a problem in the game. Any time someone mention any words related to bugs or a database, immediately my mind and body kicks into motion as if I were filing for work.</p>

<p>I've noticed this at other workplaces as well. Three-letter abbreviations become God, such as TPS reports. "Something-something-something TPS reports." "So-and-so-TPS reports-so-and-so." The workplace conversations become almost like techno, with a guaranteed beat of someone hitting some combination of words related to those damned TPS reports. The corporate world, with its efficient division of labor, naturally becomes this way.</p>

<p>Repetition has been on my mind a lot lately. I wonder why...</p>
