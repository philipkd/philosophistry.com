<h1>Rothkoization</h1>

<p>How does one develop the ultimate color stripe?</p>

<p>You can either:<br />
a) Use your intuition<br />
b) Use a <a href="http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html">color scheme generator</a></p>

<p>My experience with color scheme generators is that they tend to produce color schemes that fall into discrete and boring categories. For example, you get a lot of pastel pallettes, or you get consistently bright super-harmonious primary-like colors, a la Nintendo Famicon or kid toys. Actually, that above generator that I linked to seems pretty good and I'll have to explore that.</p>

<p>I was at Modern Book in Palo Alto and saw a book, on the cover of which were a figure eight drawn with a line that looked exactly like this:</p>

<p><img src="../../scans/2006/05/strip-8book.gif"></p>

<p>I was so stunned by the color combination that I spent a couple minutes staring at it and memorizing the color scheme. And you know how hard it is to memorize distinct and subtle differences between colors, but believe me, I brought out the big guns of self-articulation when I worked at it.</p>

<p>Googling around apparently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471289280?v=glance">The Art of Color</a> seems to be the tome-to-get on color theory. I liked the subtitle: <i>The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.</i></p>

<p>Me, being the evolution-nut I am, I looked into <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/vision.html">The Evolution of Color Vision</a> which I'll have to get to later (the theory being that, for example, red does things to us just as cherries among a sea of greenish-yellow plains would do something to our ancestral apes). Instead I <a href="http://www.marktaw.com/design/ColorTheorya.html">read something more accessible about color theory</a>.</p>

<p>The other common strategy is to <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/04/color-palette-of-the-caribbean">look to nature</a>. That's not bad actually. But I think then all you'll get are "nature-palettes" which is fine if that's your thang.</p>

<p>I think it goes deeper than that, into the nature of what we notice in nature. So I took a mental snapshot of my frosted glass table with calculator and myself wearing a lime green shirt, and thought about what was the fundamental colorized message of that screenshot. i.e. In only 7 strips of evenly sized colors laid out top to bottom, as a longer rectangle, how could I communicate the same aesthetic that just looking at my desk gave me:</p>

<p><img src="../../scans/2006/05/strip-desk.gif"></p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with that. Keep in mind, that's not a <i>replica</i> of my desk, but I extracted what was the most beautiful elements expressed in a single scene captured by my mind's eye.</p>

<p>The default is great too, lol. <i>no-color</i> color = pure shape, form, universe, void</p>

<p><img src="../../scans/2006/05/strip-default.gif"></p>

<p>But I think stumbling upon a color combination that catches your eye is still a good heuristic. Like how I found that 8-book above. For example, I saw this spectrum:</p>

<p><img src="../../scans/2006/05/spectrum.jpg"></p>

<p>And I liked how the red tappered off logrithmically into the darker red. It's like that fricking CHERRY. yumm. So I just extracted that and tried that.</p>

<p><img src="../../scans/2006/05/strip-cherry.gif"></p>

<p>Not bad. I can almost eat that.</p>

<p>However, in the strips created above they don't rise to the level of the 8-book one I mentioned above. I've TRIED creating strips before, but all I get are things like my desk one or stuff like the scheme generator. They all get this flat harmony. While as the 8-book one uses a wide range of weird colors and still pulls it off. DAH!</p>

<p>There's an artist, though, a TON more obsessed about this than I am.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nga.gov/feature/rothko/">Mark. Rothko.</a></p>

<p>Albeit, he's kind of an egotist: On one of the captions for his paintings that I saw said something along the lines of, "The reason why some people break down and cry in front of my paintings is because I am fully hitting on the pure emotion. This is agony, or this is ebullience."</p>

<p>People cry in front of paintings? What's wrong with them?</p>

<p>Rothko is a genius though.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nga.gov/feature/rothko/classic2.shtm">From Original Rothko 1950</a><br />

<p><a href="http://www.nga.gov/feature/rothko/classic1.shtm">From Original Rothko 	1949</a><br />
<img src="../../scans/2006/05/strip-rothko-49.gif"></p>

<p>Pretty satisfied with the results. The bottom especially, it actually has a message beyond "ooh, harmony, pleasant!"</p>

There are some nice colours and palettes in there.<br />
