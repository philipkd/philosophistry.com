<h1>Cambio de Philosophy Introduccion: Try changing some fundamental philosophical beliefs...</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Friday May 19, 2006  1:36 PM

<p>So here we go, I'm going to attempt to change my positions on these philosophical debates: the existence of God, reality is objective, and purpose is not about personal happiness maximization, but humanity. Since philosphers haven't settled any of them, they're all up for grabs.</p>

<p>Some element of double-think is involved here. I must disclaim that at my core level, I'm undecided about all these questions. However, that core level is not relevant in practice. In our real, day-to-day living, we make decisions according to strategies and heuristics that are patterned after beliefs about the nature of the universe. (I'm not alone in this perspective: famous biologist Dawkins says he's an agnostic inside, but in practice an atheist).</p>

<p>In the next three posts I will pitch a reversal of beliefs to myself. </p>

<p>This almost seems like a desecration, a violation of some sort of code. But when you're born into a religious house, aren't your beliefs chosen for you? When you choose to be curious and read different sacred texts, haven't you chosen to be open-minded and thus open to changing your beliefs? So I'm asking myself to have an open-mind.</p>

<p>I could have just put it that way, but it's important to communicate a major theme here on philosophsitry, that of self-programming.</p>

<p>(There is an elephant-in-the-room: that this kind of practice implies I believe in a subjective reality or in agnosticism. This strikes at the heart of those debilitating meta-problems that gives me pure-obsession nightmares: how can you change the hand that changes! So for my own health, I'll ignore this meta-question.)</p>
