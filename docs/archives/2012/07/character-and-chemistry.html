<h1>Is There a Secret for Finding The One?</h1>

                                        <p><a href="http://characterandchemistry.com/"><img src="../../scans/2012/charchemcover.png" class="charchemcover" style="  -moz-border-radius:    5px;  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;  border-radius:         5px;    -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.46);  -moz-box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.46);  box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.46); "></a></p>

<p>My second book is out now! It's called <a href="http://characterandchemistry.com/">Character & Chemistry</a> and it's all about love. The book contains everything you need to figure out whether the person you're dating is a keeper. It's based on a simple two-part system: Character & Chemistry. That's it. Two variables. Not 29 like eHarmony. And not 1 like "go with your gut" or "listen to your heart."</p>

<p>The principle is as follows:</p>

<div style="background-color: lavenderblush; padding: 10px">"Only date people of good character with whom you also have good chemistry."</div>

<p>I've been cultivating this idea for a while, pitching it to friends over and over again, and have turned many skeptics into believers. I created a Tumblr blog called <a href="http://shouldidatesomeonewho.com/">ShouldIDateSomeoneWho.com</a>, and I've created a neat parlor trick in the process. You can <a href="http://shouldidatesomeonewho.com/ask">ask me any question</a> of the form "Should I Date Someone Who ...", and I can--without fail--find an answer from Character & Chemistry.</p>

<p>Now, just because you read the book, that doesn't mean you'll automatically find the one. After people have settled on my idea, their next question is often, "Why is it so hard to find Character & Chemistry?" I don't have a complete answer for that, and that may be the premise for a sequel. Maybe people get desperate, or maybe people have a misguided notion of what relationships are for. Either way, my book makes a bold claim: "It's better to be single than be stuck with someone with so-so character or so-so chemistry."</p>

<p><a href="http://characterandchemistry.com/">Read the book</a> to find out more. If you don't have time to read, then take the <a href="http://ishetheonequiz.com/">5-minute quiz: Is He The One?</a></p>
