<p>Really fascinating article in the New Yorker about recent advances in the study of placebos:<blockquote class="huff">They have found, for example, that diazepam&mdash;more commonly known as Valium&mdash;has no discernible effect on anxiety unless a person knows he is taking it</blockquote>Also:<blockquote class="huff">This year, Harvard created an institute dedicated wholly to their study [of placebos], the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter.</blockquote>And:<blockquote class="huff">In most cases, the larger the pill, the stronger the placebo effect. Two pills are better than one, and brand-name pills trump generics. Capsules are generally more effective than pills, and injections produce a more pronounced effect than either. There is even evidence to suggest that the color of medicine influences the way one responds to it: colored pills are more likely to relieve pain than white pills; blue pills help people sleep better than red pills; and green capsules are the best bet when it comes to anxiety medication</blockquote>A takeaway I get from the article is that "healing is healing is healing." Whether it's shamanism, acupuncture, or Advil, it's still healing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/12/12/111212fa_fact_specter">the article is behind a paywall</a>, but I recommend checking out the New Yorker app on your iPad or picking up an issue at the library.<br />
<h2>Comments</h2><p>Ezra said on January 23, 2012  6:27 AM: <p>Very interesting.  The diazepam dose used must have been low (1-5 mg) or clinical observations required to meet "discernable effect on anxiety" must have been very lax.  20 mg oral diazepam will sedate many non-drug tolerant patients to the point of sleep.</p></p>
