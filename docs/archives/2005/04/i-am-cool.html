<p>lol</p>

<p>roflmao</p>

<p>in the new star wars:<br />
Darth Vader discovers that he's really not for profit, changes his name to Gnu/Vader, and establishes the PanGallactic cult of RMS.</p>

<p>haha</p>

<p>lame joke</p>

<p>And the helmets are shaking their purple-dyed crests, and for the wearers of breast-plates the weavers are striking up the wise shuttle's songs, that wakes up those who are asleep.<br />
46:49</p>

<p>that's from Sophocles<br />

<p>scientists are hailing a 20% increase in total greek texts due to a recent use of technology (infra-red) by Oxford<br />

<p>err, classists<br />

<p>They even believe they are likely to find lost Christian gospels, the originals of which were written around the time of the earliest books of the New Testament.<br />
48:18</p>

<p> For more than a century, it has caused excitement and frustration in equal measure - a collection of Greek and Roman writings so vast it could redraw the map of classical civilisation. If only it was legible.</p>

<p>Now, in a breakthrough described as the classical equivalent of finding the holy grail, Oxford University scientists have employed infra-red technology to open up the hoard, known as the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, and with it the prospect that hundreds of lost Greek comedies, tragedies and epic poems will soon be revealed.<br />

<p> </p>

<p><br />
Now scientists are using multi-spectral imaging techniques developed from satellite technology to read the papyri at Oxford University's Sackler Library. The fragments, preserved between sheets of glass, respond to the infra-red spectrum - ink invisible to the naked eye can be seen and photographed.<br />
49:15</p>

<p>Academics have hailed it as a development which could lead to a 20 per cent increase in the number of great Greek and Roman works in existence..</p>

<p></p>

<p>so funny</p>
