<p>btw, RSIs and laziness is making me hate the shift button and henceforth the <<<< characters or the >>>>>>> characters, which mkes me want to just put stuff in philosophistry without hyperlinks because I hate tagging stuff in HTML.  anyways</p>

<p>WHO NEEDS HYPERLINKS ANYWAYS.  GOOGLE IS MY PERSISTENT HYPERLINK. YOU'RE BETTER OFF GOOGLING ANYTHING I SAY RATHER THAN CLICKING ON MY LINK BECAUSE WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT MY LINK WILL WORK IN 10 YEARS.</p>

<p>\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello all-\<br />
For quite some time I've been interested in the idea of allowing you the ability to tinker around with my tracks - to create remixes, experiment, embellish or destroy what's there.  I tried a few years ago to do this in shockwave with very limited results.\<br />
After spending some quality time sitting in hotel rooms on a press tour, it dawned on me that the technology now exists and is already in the hands of some of you.  I got to work experimenting and came up with something I think you'll enjoy.\<br />
What I'm giving you in this file is the actual multi-track audio session for "the hand that feeds" in GarageBand format.  This is the entire thing bounced over from the actual Pro Tools session we recorded it into.  I imported and converted the tracks into AppleLoop format so the size would be reasonable and the tempo flexible.\<br />
So...\<br />
You need a Macintosh and you need GarageBand 2.0.  If you have a newer Mac, you already have the software.  The more RAM you have the better.  I did this on a PowerBook 1.67 w/ 2G RAM but it has been running on far less powerful systems.\<br />
Drag the file over to your hard disk and double click it.  Hit the space bar.  Listen.\<br />
Change the tempo.  Add new loops.  Chop up the vocals.  Turn me into a woman.  Replay the guitar.  Anything you'd like.\<br />
I gave this to my crew and band to test out and all work effectively stopped for a while - it's fun to mess around with.  I've now heard a country version of the track as well as an abstract Latin interpretation (thanks, Leo).\<br />
There are some copyright issues involved, so read the notice that pops up.  Giving this away is an experiment.  I'm interested to see what comes of it, what issues are raised and what the results are.\<br />
Have fun-\<br />
Trent Reznor\<br />
