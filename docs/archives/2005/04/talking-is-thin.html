<h1>talking is thinking is living</h1>

<p>I love how my conversations become policy for me.</p>

<p>Some of my greatest thinking and ideas comes in the middle of a conversation, not before.  I think outloud, and for many of those I talk with, this is annoying, they want the final answer, the clear logical package.  Others enjoy ideation, and that's when conversations are the most fun for me.</p>

<p>Little emails I write eventually become mission statements for me. My assessments of situations as described to others become then the floating theme for the rest of the affair.</p>

<p>this is so vague I know, I don't know.</p>

<p>When people ask me how things are going, I can't help but research my emotions and fish for the most summary response.  I eventually then look back more at those little conversations for where I was the most lucid about the situation.</p>

<p>I have plenty of time to write in my diaries and reflect about my work experiences at Google, but it's when an old friend prompts me, that I really lay the truth down.</p>
