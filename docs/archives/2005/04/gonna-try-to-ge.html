<h1>gonna try to get back into lucid dreaming</h1>

<p>dangit, okay round four or something.</p>

<p>more like round three, this reperesnets my third attempt to get into lucid dreaming.</p>

<p>what happens is I'll have a really great dream, perhaps lucid, and then the next day, I'll be so pumped to do it, in order to get it again, and so I start writing down my dreams and doing all the methods, and I keep getting interesting dreams, but none lik ethe one that inspired me, and then I get lazy, because it involves writing down your dreams in the morning, which is pretty hard time to be productive in, especially when you have to wake up and go somewhere.</p>

<p>however I'm in a situation where I can do that, because of work and stuff I give myself like so much free time avialable in the morning, I wake up when the sunrises, and I go to bed like maybe a couple hours after the sun sets, and I have no girlfriend, so I have free time, and stuff... so, like this may be a perfect time.</p>

<p>I just hope I can keep it up, but then again, I guess what's wrong with doing it in fits and starts, like going in and then coming out, I guess it's not a big deal, it's just, I dunno.</p>

<p>like I had a really great dream the other day, it was soo real, how do I get that kind of stuff back again.</p>

<p>i guess I have to motivate myself on a couple of things.  so yeah, hopefully this will be the last attempt and lucid dreaming becomes an integral part of my life, or something, we'll see won't we.</p>
