<h1>Using Excel to Track My Happiness</h1>

<p><a href="../../scans/2005/04/Happiology.xls">Click here to download 8 months of data on my levels of happiness.</a></p>

<p>Scroll down for the basic story. Here is a screen shot:<br />
<img src="../../scans/2005/04/Happiology.gif"></p>

<p>I had been feeling an atmospheric sadness since I was 17, but it wasn't till I was 21 that I determined to make happiness my project. Along the way, I picked up a book by Martin Seligman, <i>Authentic Happiness</i>, that showed me some scientific aspects of <i>Happiology</i>.</p>

<p>One of the take-aways was a comprehensive list of human emotions, categorized by their emphasis: either positive or negative, affecting the past, present, or future. For example, faith is an emotion that's positive and future-oriented. Agony is a present-oriented negative emotion.  This list of about thirty emotions became the rows in my excel spreadsheet. I tracked my progress weekly and took the average of all the scores. I started off with a simple stat based on this equation: avg(positive) - avg(negative) = balance. It then became my weekly goal to bring my Affect balance to a 4.0 or so.  That could mean, for example, a 7 on positive emotions minus a 3 on negative.</p>

<p>The numbers are based on a scale from 0 to 10. 0 means a "no" response, 10 means "very much so." So I would ask myself, aloud even, "Phil, do you have optimism?" I'd then respond as honestly as possible. i.e. "sure, I'm optimistic" would translate into a 5.</p>

<p>I gained great control over my Affect Balance, and ten weeks into it, I had reached a score of 6.3, the result of an 8.8 in positive affect minus a 2.4 negative. But, in spite of these high sensations, I didn't feel really happy. So I changed the measurement focus from atomic emotions to answering broader questions. These became my "Prime Qualia Measures:"</p>

<p>Am I happy?<br />
Do I feel good?<br />
Is life good?<br />
Zest<br />
Contentment<br />
Optimism<br />
Peace of Mind<br />
Do I want to die?<br />
Am I depressed?</p>

<p>These numbers were much harder to control but not as fickle as the Affect balance. Over four months I developed an upward trend, eventually reaching a 9.9 average on all the Prime Qualia Measures. This was indeed a very good time in my life.</p>

<p>I was riding high for three weeks, but then some interviewers called me back. I decided to take the job opportunity, but since then my numbers have been far off their high. I could have refused the opportunity, but I was curious to see if I could still be close to a 10 with a corporate job.</p>

<p>My life right now is a test of that hypothesis.<br />

Moodstats is an application that allows you to quickly record & rate how your day has been in six different categories. You can also attach comments to these values to further illustrate why your moods are the way they are.</p>

<p>The identifying feature is the ability to graph the progress over time and compare it with everyone else.  All the data is XML-driven, the app is light-weight.</p>

<p>I dig it.</p></p>

I admire your dedication.  I probably would have started forgetting to put entries in after the first couple of weeks.<br />
