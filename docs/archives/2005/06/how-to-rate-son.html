<h1>How to rate songs in iTunes</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Sunday Jun  5, 2005  9:42 PM

<p>The standard approach in a 5-star system is to give your favorite songs all 5 stars, and then plain-old "good" songs 4 stars.</p>

<p>I think the better approach is to start with one-star to peg songs in your collection that you think are worth coming back to again. Treat the star as the same as the GMail star, which is just meant to peg an item.</p>

<p>Then, if, you feel that a song is outstanding, only then do you give it a second star. And then, for songs that get repeatedly played, like more than 30 times, then you give it 3 stars.</p>

<p>The point is that, after a year or so, you should only have one song in your entire collection with 5 stars. Then maybe five songs with 4 stars, and like twenty-five songs with 3 stars, and so on, exponentially decaying.</p>

You can create Smart Lists that filter for various attributes like # of times played.  You don't need to "overload" the stars to do it.<br />
