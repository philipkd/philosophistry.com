<h1>It's 5am, why am I still up?</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Tuesday Jun  7, 2005  5:14 AM

<p>I'm not a big coffee drinker, nor do I drink Coke and Pepsi. I'm also light on the amount of chocolate that I eat. So I guess it surprised me that, on a day that I had been working out, that I'd end up waking up in the middle of the night, at 5am, not feeling sleepy at all.</p>

<p>Which led me to this interesting fact: <a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro00/web3/Patel.html">caffeine takes 6 hours to diminish by half in your body</a>. If I remember correctly, at around 9pm, I had this nice pint (16 oz.) of thai iced tea. Whoops, that'll be the last time I have tea, chocolate, or anything caffeinated near dinnertime.</p>

<p>I've generally been against caffeine. It releases adrenaline which basically what is released when you're under stress. Plus, you get addicted. Then there's my latent ideological attitude toward it: caffeine is proof that someone has sold-out his or her body for the sake of a high-stress lifestyle.</p>

<p>Two weeks into my recent corporate job, I started getting sleepy after lunch, and instead of investigating the matter, I took some tea. This eventually became a regular affair, and I felt guilty about it. Because my thinking has been that if I really enjoy and care about my work, my enthusiasm will give me the requisite energy. Instead, I was compensating my dispassion with a drug to keep me productive. Dispassionate work is stressful enough as it is, but when you throw in caffeine, that's even more stress.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I admit it's nice to find some pleasure and an instant boost to productivity in a cup.</p>

<p>As a side note, this reminds me of this wacko near where I live: Steve Keetz, <a href="http://www.coffeedonut.net/">the anti-caffeine activist</a>.</p>

My body is a tool for my mind to use.  I'll do whatever I want to it to make it do what I want.  If caffeine makes it run longer, then caffeine is welcome.  Every choice has to be balanced with long-term consequences of course, just like any other choice in life.<br />
