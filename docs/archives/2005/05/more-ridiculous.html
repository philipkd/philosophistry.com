<p><i>While you were stuck in your crappy institutional high school trying to find a way to sneak out during study hall, some rich kid up the street was spending his days in ivy covered halls taking classes like Depression Era Economics and the Rise of Fascism. Not only was he rich, but he was classically good looking, smart and he managed to be a natural athlete as well. He probably didn’t play football but he was captain of his school’s soccer or lacrosse team. You rode bikes around the hood together or played baseball up at the local park, but he lived in a different world than you. He came from a long line of rich, sturdy people, and good genetics has blessed him with smarts, looks, athletic ability and ostensibly a bright future. He was the golden boy, he could do anything well and so people expected more from him.</p>

<p>The Sony Ericsson S710a is that golden boy.<br />

<p>It has the highest user satisfaction ratings I've seen on the net and is a pretty good camera phone. My curent cellphone is crapping out, and my digicam is too high maintenance (sucks up AA batteries that I have to babysit in a recharger, ugh).</p></p>
