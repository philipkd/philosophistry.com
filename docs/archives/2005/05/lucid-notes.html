<h1>lucid notes?</h1>

<p><em>When I was into lucid dreaming, I had to keep a notebook by my bed for me to jot down my dreams before I forgot them. I'm usually really tired when these were written, usually they are written in the dark, sometimes around 4am.</em></p>

<p>- What about that sensation of nihilism and nothing compared to movement enthusiasm?</p>

<p>- Down the ocean stuck under wood, conceived light, waiting for Caroline. Something sharp hits my fingers.</p>

<p>- Across hall, Albert lives, and he comes to me, saying he found my key, or rather a key that works for all doors, it has writing on its smooth, circular, golden end. Albert was really nice, which is odd given my mental image of him. I did not need the key, so he retreated back.</p>

<p>- I had forgotten the readhead's name and I was afraid.</p>

<p>- Satan's elevator roller coaster ride, sword in hand, have to get Mary to convince keeper of gates beyond the numbers. I had a partner w/ me, holding shit for me. He pointed there: "Look, they have no souls." Roller coaster segments while holding knife. I was pissed. Ppl tried to know wassup. The whole place was uber-expensive, futuristic, posh.</p>

And how often do you have these dreams? </p>

<p>I know, it might seem strange that I'm interested in such things, but it is due to a result of recently studying this and lingering thoughts.</p>

<p>this is alll.</p></p>

The dreams I was writing down were actually just vivid dreams, not lucid ones. lucid being the ones that I can control. I have had only a handful of lucid dreams, maybe 20 or so, and usually I obtain control for what seems like about 15-30 sec.</p>

<p>I currently don't have lucid dreams, and rarely have vivid dreams anymore. However, to get into lucid dreaming, one of the suggestions is to take dream notes, which is what you see on my blog.</p></p>
