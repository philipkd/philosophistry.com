<h1>Why Socialism?</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Saturday Jan  8, 2005  1:19 PM

<p>I found this quote mentioned by some guy on thefacebook.com.  It's interesting to say the least<blockquote>I have now reached the point where I may indicate briefly what to me constitutes the essence of the crisis of our time. It concerns the relationship of the individual to society. The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence. Moreover, his position in society is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate. All human beings, whatever their position in society, are suffering from this process of deterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure, lonely, and deprived of the naive, simple, and unsophisticated enjoyment of life. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society.</p>

<p>The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor -- not by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p>

<p><i>From Albert Einstein, <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/Einstein.htm">"Why Socialism?"</a></i><br />

On a related note, in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338751/">The Aviator</a>, Hughes tells a group of high-society socialists something like, "You don't care about money because you have it... Some people work for a living."<br />
