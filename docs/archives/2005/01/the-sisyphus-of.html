<h1>The Sisyphus of My Sleep</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Saturday Jan  1, 2005  2:50 PM 
<br><a href="/archives/awesome_dream_log.html">awesome dream log</a></h2>

<p>I had the most horrible nightmare.  It was beautiful.</p>

<p>In the dream, I ran up to people I knew and yelled into their face their worst traits.</p>

<p>"You think you're so special!"</p>

<p>"Your jokes aren't funny!"</p>

<p>Because of the provocation, I also physically attacked my targets to avoid retribution.  So I shoved the narcissist over the banister.  Or I socked the toad in the stomach.</p>

<p>But then my victims became my assailants.  They leaped over fallen couches and negotiated through cornfields in order to pound my face into the mud.</p>

<p>The attackers never quite finished me off, so I lived to reveal another nasty trait, only to be beaten again.</p>

<p>I tried to wake from this horrifice, but never could.</p>

<p>The dream droned into such a long hellish cycle that I naturally started to accept my fate.  Acceptance changed nothing, however, as I still tried to escape, albeit half-heartedly.  By this point, the cycle became theatre and I started to enjoy it.</p>

<p>But eventually, the real nightmare began.  The vibration and synthesized ringer from my cellphone woke me up for real.  A friend had called me, and I thought of yelling his bad trait into the phone.  Instead, I kept the conversation curt as I yearned to return back to my dream.  But I knew such a thing was useless.<br />
