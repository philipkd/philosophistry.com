<h1>Forget the GLAT</h1>

<p>Trying to get a job at Google is ridiculous, so many interviews.  They even have this GLAT, Google Labs Aptitude Test.  Check it out, some of the questions are <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/09/pencils-down-people.html" target="_blank">really hard</a>.</p>

<p>So forget that.  I'm going to work at 7-Eleven, a popular 24/7 convenience store in the US.</p>

<p>To my dismay, though, there is a standardized test on the back of 7-Eleven's application:</p>

<p><b>Basic Math Skills</b><br />
<ol><li>A customer purchased items in your store totaling $12.64.  They hand you three $5.00 bills.  How much change would you owe them?</li><br />
<li>You owe a customer $1.38 in change.  What bills and coins would you give back to the customer as correct change?</li><br />
<li>You currently have 12 bottles of water on your shelf, and want to keep a minimum level of 6 bottles at all times.  You average sales of 2 bottles per day.  What is the minimum number you would order for enough bottles for 7 days?</li><br />
<li>Your store sells 6 hot dogs per day.  How many hot dogs would you order for a two weeks supply?</li><br />
<li>A customer asks for two money orders.  The first is for the amount of $637.24 and the second is for $25.76.  If there is a $1.00 charge for each money order, what is the total amount the customer would owe you?</li><br />
</ol></p>

<p>Sweet!  These are the kind of math questions I had in middle school that boosted my confidence.  None are trick questions either!</p>

<p>Does anybody even use Google anymore?  I spend most of my info-hunting on <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> now.  (Just kidding, but there are some elements of truth to this)<br />

Please tell me there is hope upon graduating. . . Otherwise, I feel like I should probably start warming myself up to the idea of working the night-shift at 7-eleven early.. hm.</p></p>

<p>One way to prepare is to develop some skills or some sort of trade.  College is a great time to hit up those low-paying or unpaid interships.  At the very least, you can use those to prove to your prospective employer that you can generate immediate value for their company.</p>

<p>Or you can wing it at some entry-level thing.  I remember a talk by this CEO who is worth half a billion now, who just after college took the first thing that came up: tech support.  Then he kind of developed a good network, impressed people along the way, expanded his responsibilities, until eventually he was mananging his own companies.</p>

<p>Or you can get a hook-up.  Someone you know trusts that you're good at a particular thing and places you in a team.</p>

<p>Or you can start a business.</p>

<p>Or you can just navel-gaze and work at 7/11.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless</p></p>
