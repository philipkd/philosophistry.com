<h1>nature's harmonic simultaneous 4-day time cube</h1>

<p>I'm doing a little experiment. Have you heard of <a href="http://www.timecube.com/">TimeCube</a>? It's a pretty funny page with large-font text talking about an academic conspiracy to make us not realize that everything is based on rules of four (which is odd since cubes should be associated with the numbers 8, 6, and 3&mdash;I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out why I chose these three numbers). Wikipedia has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timecube">good entry on TimeCube</a>.</p>

<p>I made a site for picking lottery numbers to see how many hits it gets. In the <a href="http://www.philosophistry.com/specials/timecube_method.html">text for the site</a> I included TimeCube references along with some creative writing, i.e. bull crap.</p>

<p>Here's the link, specially worded to maximize Google PageRank:</p>

<p><a href="/specials/timecube.html">Get free, best, winning, lucky lotto, lottery, numbers, using our Time Cube astrology software.</a></p>

<p>In the process, I discovered Gail Howard's <a href="http://www.smartluck.com/lmg.htm">lottery guide, which is hilarious</a>. Here are some sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tell if a number is about to start a long losing streak before it loses 15 or 20 games or more.
<li>Know when to play -- or when not to play -- a specific number for a specific drawing.
<li>See how often you can expect to trap the six, five, four or three winning numbers in your wheeled group
<li>Tell which "cold" number is best to play. (No, it is not the number out the longest!)
<li>Detect at a glance which numbers are hot and which are not.
<li>Avoid playing Lotto numbers that are sure to lose.
<li>Cash in on the luck of others.
<li>Eliminate one quarter to one fifth of the Lotto numbers in your state's game and turn a 49-number game into a 39-number game.
<li>Know how many cold, lukewarm, and hot numbers to include on your tickets.
<li>Spot a Hot Number before it gets hot -- so you can be on it when it starts its winning streak.
</ul>
If my life was governed rigidly by mathematics, I would be as equally willing to bet 1-2-3-4-5 as I would something like 2-22-24-31-38-61. Although you shouldn't bet in the first place.

<p>Zachariensis said on August 18, 2005  1:06 AM: <p>Also: Phil Duchamp! I love it; I burst out laughing. Beautiful.</p></p>

<p><a title="http://www.cubicao.tk" href="http://www.cubicao.tk" rel="nofollow">Time Cube Traveller</a> said on September 13, 2005  3:34 AM: <p>To Zachariensis: the Cube's connection to the number 4 stems from its 4 corners. Its corners are its vertical edges. That is, the edges parallel to its rotational axis. Now, the axis itself passes through the centre of one face and the centre of the opposite face, those two faces being designated the "top" and "bottom".</p>
