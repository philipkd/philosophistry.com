<p>What follows are various photos and factoids to give myself and others a macro perspective of Hurricane Katrina's effect on New Orleans.<br />

From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Hurricane_Katrina_wind_swath.gif">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the 2004 New Orleans population to be 20.0% white and 67.9% black</p>

<p>The median income for a household in the city is $27,133</p>

<p>New Orleans is usually pronounced by locals as "Noo Aw-lins". The term "N'Awlins" is not generally used by locals but has been popularized by the tourist trade</p>

<p>Reports from the Associated Press state that 80% of the near 500,000 had evacuated safely from New Orleans prior to the hurricane's landfall. Even if licensed drivers had been available and the available buses had been used to evacuate the remaining approximately 150,000 people, they may not have made it to safety before landfall.</p>

from <a href="http://www.crt.state.la.us/crt/profiles/history.htm">Louisiana History</a></p>

<p>The five largest ancestries in the state are: African American (32.5%), French/French Canadian (16.2%), American (10.1%), German (7.1%), Irish (7%).<br />
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana">Louisiana</a>)</p>

<p>Before 9/11 the Federal Emergency Management Agency listed the three most likely catastrophic disasters facing America: a terrorist attack on New York, a major earthquake in San Francisco and a hurricane strike on New Orleans. "The New Orleans hurricane scenario," The Houston Chronicle wrote in December 2001, "may be the deadliest of all." It described a potential catastrophe very much like the one now happening.<br />
