<h1>100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. And Why?</h1>

<p>I finished reading Bernard Goldberg's book <i>100 People Who Are Screwing Up America</i> and I have <a href="/specials/100-people.html">summarized the contents here</a>.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2><p>'Lin' said on August 13, 2005  8:35 PM: <p>So out of curiosity - what is your take on the book?</p>

<p>Your synopsis was interesting, but I didn't find much personal opinion on the contents the author included (although I might have not been reading that well between the lines as I was just scanning over it). </p></p>

Maybe it's because I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, or that my friends are liberals, or that I read liberal websites (plastic.com, slate.com), but for some reason I don't always hear the other side.</p>

<p>Not that Goldberg's counts as the other side, at least it reminds me that there are tons of idiot liberals.</p>

<p>However, it didn't move me any bit from being a liberal. In some ways, it made me more liberal, because it presented the pettiness of his positions.</p>

<p>Really, the book is an old guy cussing at his TV. Damn kids and their rap music. Damn beautiful celebrities and their lack of patriotism.</p></p>
