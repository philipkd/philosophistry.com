<h1>Transcendental Meditation: The Return of the Blissful Wanderer?</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Tuesday Nov  1, 2005  3:46 PM

<p>My mind wanders all the time, but it's not always pleasant. With all-consuming work and the general anxiety that comes from being young and hungry, my thoughts are generally directed toward solving a problem. You know how they say, "to a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Well my mind is often like an out-of-tune piano with the hammers banging on stringy situations that tangle me up.</p>

<p>I broke through this discordant melody with transcendental meditation (TM) yesterday. The technical features of TM usually are sitting down and repeating a mantra, which can be any combination of words or sounds, for about fifteen to twenty minutes. Well, actually a more practical definition of TM is "meditation with the intent to trip-out." The best way to describe my most recent TM-trip is that of a "blissful wander."</p>

<p>I will contrast here the "blissful wanderer" with the "anxious explorer." Both travelers navigate aimlessly. But the explorer measures progress as the distance from A to B. His problems are open, and success is defined as achieving closure. His destiny is a paved curve.</p>

<p>The wanderer measures progress as the quality of the current location. There is a plurality of destinations. He goes from A through Z, and success is defined as obtaining play. His destiny is a connected sequence of clouds.</p>

<p>TM re-acquainted me with blissful wandering. This is how it happened. It was about 10pm, nobody was in the house, and so I turned off the lights and sat on my bed with my back propped against the wall. I then repeated some random mantra: "um nama, narayana." (This has no particular Hindu significance to me. I culled it from a techno song from Prodigy.) I repeated the mantra with my eyes closed, and I eventually became that cloud-hopper.</p>

<p>I reflected on memories and scenes that haven't been touched in years. I resuscitated various goals and desires that had been shelved for the sake of expediency. I basically day-dreamt, and it was great.</p>

<p>Eventually it became harder to repeat the mantra. I lost myself so much in the blissful wandering that I forgot what I was even doing. I wasn't really getting sleepy, but rather it felt like I was bypassing sleep and going straight to dreaming. Then I hit a lucid state.</p>

<p>The lucid state is reminiscent of the few seconds or minutes that you are still dreaming while waking up. In this dream-like state, you realize you are awake, but you keep your eyes closed and can still feel vividly immersed in dream imagery.</p>

<p>The difference between general imagination and lucidity is that when you imagine something, you think <i>of</i> the imagery&mdash;the images are in your head. In the lucid state, you look <i>at</i> your visualizations. Images appear in front of you and have a realistic perspective.</p>

<p>After the lucid state, I fell into a deep slumber for a couple hours. As I awoke, I couldn't exactly remember where I had been, nor was I sure of where I was going.  However, I was certainly content with where I was at.<br />
