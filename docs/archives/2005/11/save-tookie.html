<h1>Save Tookie?</h1>

<p>When one person kills another, there is <br />
immediate revulsion at the nature of the <br />
crime.  But in a time so short as to seem <br />
indecent to the members of the personal <br />
family, the dead person ceases to exist as an <br />
identifiable figure.  To those individuals in <br />
the community of good will and empathy, <br />
warmth and compassion, only one of the key <br />
actors in the drama remains with whom to <br />
commiserate—and that is always the <br />
criminal.  The dead person ceases to be a <br />
part of everyday reality, ceases to exist.  She <br />
is only a figure in a historic event.  We <br />
inevitably turn away from the past, toward <br />
the ongoing reality.  And the ongoing reality <br />
is the criminal; trapped, anxious, now <br />
helpless, isolated, often badgered and <br />
bewildered.  He usurps the compassion that <br />
is justly his victim’s due.  He will steal his <br />
victim’s moral constituency along with her <br />
life.</p>

"If Stan `Tookie' Williams had been born in Connecticut in the same type of situation, and was a white man, he would have been running a company," says Foxx, who gained some 25 pounds to resemble the hulking inmate. "But born a black man who has the capability of having brute strength and the capability of being smart in the ways of the world, he's going to get into what he gets into."</p>
