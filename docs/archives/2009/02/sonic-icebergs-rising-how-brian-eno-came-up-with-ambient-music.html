<h1>Sonic Icebergs Rising: How Brian Eno came up with 'Ambient' music</h1>

<p>All heroes should write diaries. Not memoirs, but diaries. Diaries help you get inside their heads and copy their algorithms for emulation purposes. This is why I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571179959?ie=UTF8&tag=philosophistr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571179959">Brian Eno's diary</a>.</p>

<p>Every time I pick it up, I find something inspiring. This is from page 294, how he came up with the idea for ambient music:<blockquote class="huff">This became clear to me when I was confined to bed, immobilized by an accident in early 1975. My friend Judy Nylon had visited, and brought with her a record of 17th-century harp music. I asked her to put it on as she left, which she did, but I it wasn't until she'd gone that I realized that the hi-fi was much too quiet and one of the speakers had given up anyway. It was raining hard outside, and I could hardly hear the music above the rain - just the loudest notes, like little crystals, sonic icebergs rising out of the storm. I couldn't get up and change it, so I just lay there waiting for my next visitor to come and sort it out, and gradually I was seduced by the listening experience. I realized that this was what I wanted music to be - a place, a feeling, an all-around tint to my sonic environment.</blockquote><br />
