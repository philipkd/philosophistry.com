<p>I'll admit, I don't believe in evolution deep in my bones. The theory of evolution is something I rationally acknowledge to be true, but I can't comprehend evolution the same way that I can't comprehend really large numbers like a million or a billion. You say that a million Earths could fit inside the Sun? I don't have grasp of what that means. Likewise, I <i>guess</i> a billion years of mutations and natural selection would eventually lead bacteria to become a human. Who really knows?</p>

<p>I think I'm sold on the mechanics of evolution. The fittest do survive, and they have changes that they pass on. But damned if I still don't have an internalized confidence in how the eye evolved. It doesn't matter how many damn times I read about it. Or take the evolution of consciousness and our ability to perceive colors. For example, how do I know that the Green that I see is the same as the Green that others see? Where is that green stored in my mind? Again, who knows how that kind of phenomena could have evolved.<br />
