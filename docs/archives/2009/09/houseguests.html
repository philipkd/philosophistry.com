<p>As I write this, I potentially have someone watching over my shoulder. My friend is sleeping on a couch behind me, he probably can't read my screen from that distance, and he's probably asleep, but there's always a chance that he can read this. Despite his quietude, he's present.</p>

<p><img src="../../scans/2009/09/houseofcards.jpg"></p>

<p>I have this image in my head of Radiohead's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nTFjVm9sTQ">House of Cards music video</a> where Thom Yorke's face is mapped by a 3D camera so that it looks like he's swimming in a sea of polygons.</p>

<p><img src="../../scans/2009/09/carbonite.jpg"></p>

<p>It's like the frozen Han Solo's face extruding from the carbonite. What I see in these two images is how my awareness is drawn and teased away when others are in the room. I become partially less aware of myself and a little constantly aware of the other. Even if the other person is completely silent, sleeping in my room, extra resources are devoted to making sure I don't make any noises. Or let's say they're even sleeping in the next room, at any moment they could burst in, so I have to modify my behavior to prepare for that event. For example, I won't be doing naked yoga. That would make things awkward.</p>

<p>They also say that people who live alone, but have pets, lead healthier lives, both physically and psychically. One idea is that you develop more empathy. I read a study showing that children who grow up with pets develop more empathy. But perhaps, it has more to do with how pets impact your attention. You always, at minimum, have a background process running in your mind tracking their movements and needs. This creates enough of a distraction that you avoid over-thinking and over-introspection, two common causes of depression and dysphoria.<br />
