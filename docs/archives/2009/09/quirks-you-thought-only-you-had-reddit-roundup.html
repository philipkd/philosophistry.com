<p><i>In the tradition of my other reddit roundup posts ("<a href="http://philosophistry.com/archives/2009/05/this_is_going_into_my_best_ever_box_of_forum_threads.html">Which of our own closely held beliefs will our own children and grandchildren by appalled by?</a>" and "<a href="http://philosophistry.com/archives/2009/07/secretly-do-reddit.html">What do you secretly do that is frowned upon by this community, but not by the world at-large?</a>"), I've selected some key posts from the "<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse">Does Anybody Else</a>" subforum (aka subreddit) of <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit</a>.</i></p>

<p><b>A brief backgrounder:</b></p>

<p>About a month ago, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/jackalope123">jackalope123</a> posted this topic:<blockquote class="huff"><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9fho2/out_of_pure_curiosity_does_anybody_else/">Out of pure curiosity, does anybody else...</a><br />
... sometimes run up stairs on all fours? I do this when I'm alone. I don't really know why, I've done it since I was a kid, but when I'm confronted with stairs, I have the urge to climb it using my arms as legs as well. Am I alone in this, or are there others?</blockquote></p>

<p>What followed has been a rapidly <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse">growing subreddit dedicated to DAEs</a> (Does Anybody Else topics). Here is a selection of posts that I think capture the same essence as the above post:</p><p><style>ul {margin-top: 0px;} li { margin-bottom: 10px; }.quirks a {font-weight: normal; color: #0061a0; } </style><div class="quirks"><ul><br />
