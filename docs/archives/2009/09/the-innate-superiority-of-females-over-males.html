<h1>The innate superiority of females over males</h1>

<p>I think a lot about gender roles and power structures between women and men. I cannot be easily pigeonholed into feminism or masculism. I can't even be pigeonedholed into the negative spaces of those fields. I'm not an anti-feminist (nor an anti-masculist). I want to somehow turn all these thoughts I have about gender roles into some kind of work, but I don't know how, so instead, I'll shoot from the hip as the ideas come.</p>

<p>This one idea will be about the innate superiority of females over males.</p>

<p>There are these nodes floating in the global consciousness, at least maybe in the academic soup, that women are more human than men. On a basic level, women do have more equipment than men. How do you define "more"? "More" can be defined by a sense of order. There is more complexity to women. There are more labels for things that women have than labels for things men have.</p>

<p>Hell, women have factories for manufacturing other people. Men ain't got nothing on that. I've often heard men expressing their jealousy of women because they can make people. The whole miracle of pregnancy and birth goes on in a woman, and when the kid comes out, the father looks at it and already knows it's more her possession than his, and he feels jealous because he didn't labor as hard to bring it into this world, even though it shares half his genes.  Even when a man complains about the under appreciation of his contribution to child rearing&mdash;"I put food on the table!"&mdash;they always seem like crocodile tears.</p>

<p>If I piece together things I've read in biology, it's like men are reduced, pruned-down females. Women are XX while as men are a stunted growth XY shrivel. After the pruning, they are then amped up with testosterone which explains why they ultimately become more powerful.</p>

<p>Forget brain power. Sure men have more spatial cognitive capabilities, and probably better aptitude at numbers, but women have better judgment and can multitask. If you were creating an artificial intelligence, it would be harder to make a woman than a man. Because to program the extra features that men have, such as the ability to move through 3D spaces and crunch numbers, it would not be as hard as programming the extra features that women have.</p>

<p>And yet, I believe in the importance of men and think masculism is a very under appreciated field of study.<br />
