<p>It's just simple economics. The supply of entertainment has become so vast and infinite that the only reasonable price is zero.</p>

<p>Maybe it's that, not file-sharing technology itself, that has made piracy rates so high.</p>

<p>And yet, there's a few constants for the future that should give anybody in that business hope:<ul><li>Official distributors will still have the <i>ability</i> to provide more convenient, reliable, and quality delivery than piracy. And people are willing to pay for that.<br />
<li>How much people spend determines how much they care about each other. You can only gift something that he/she can't get for free.<br />
<li>Social spaces will always have a price. Think expensive concerts.</ul></p>

<p>In other words, even if piracy were unbridled by legal restrictions, the Entertainment business would still be a good business.<br />
