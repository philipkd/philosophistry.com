<p>I love meme-spotting.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/115717/What-does-back-off-mean">Anonymous asked MetaFilter, "What does 'back off' mean?"</a> She then goes on to describe a weekend of missed calls to her boyfriend, culminating in an abrupt email from him stating, "This isn't working, back off."</p>

<p>scody replied with a handy comment:<blockquote class="huff"><i>I feel like this is a no win situation and just wonder if this is his immature way to break up for good with no conversation responsibility.</i></p>

<p>I think you nailed it. It's what I call a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire">Reichstag fire</a> breakup -- create a nasty conflagration that you can then blame on the other party as justification for moving on. It's a small, nasty, coward's way out. It's also not that uncommon, though one would hope that someone in his late 30s would have grown out of it.</blockquote><a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/115717/What-does-back-off-mean#1660120">Read the rest of his comment here</a>.</p>

<p>Similar thing happened to a friend of mine recently.<br />

<p>I remember having that feeling with a high-school break-up.  Wondering if I could somehow avoid that break-up explanation discussion because I knew that I would be stoically sitting there next to someone who would be crying to me.</p>

<p>The funny factors are the age of the people involved, the length of the relationship, and the sort of unequivocal language he's using that is still somehow unclear.</p>

<p>Saying "back off" to someone you love means one thing, and saying "back off" to someone you don't love anymore means another.  Here confusion is totally justifiable.  Men...</p></p>
