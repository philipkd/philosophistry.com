<h1>The only rational response to the financial markets is insanity.</h1>

<p>Just saw this flash up on Drudge Report: <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090308/D96Q45M00.html">Recession on track to be the longest in postwar period</a>.</p>

<p>Seriously, at this point, am I supposed to trust any of these guys' predictions? When things were already good, they were pumping things up. Now that things are already bad, they're telling everybody to run away. </p>

<p>You might as well be a contrarian to maximize your returns.</p>

<p>Hmm, to invest or not to invest? Clearly you can't think "well, things are so bad, I shouldn't invest." Who knows whether this is the bottom where you'll be regretting later, "man I should have gotten in then." Well if you want to play it safe, you could keep your money in cash. But then inflation will inevitably erode the value of that.</p>

<p>I think the only rational response to the financial markets is insanity.<br />
