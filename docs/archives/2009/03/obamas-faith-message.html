<h1>Obama's "Faith" Message</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.philosophistry.com/archives/2009/03/faith_is_important.html">This is related to my previous post on faith</a>. I'm of the belief that Obama's "Hope" message was just code for "Faith." You can substitute the word "Hope" everywhere in his speeches with "Faith" and they would still make sense. Playing this message was the only way he could get elected. It was clear to Obama, his campaign team, and everybody in the world, that his lack of experience was his largest trait, even larger than his race. Or maybe his race was intertwined with this issue, in that non-black people need to have more faith in black people, and black people need to have more faith in themselves.<br />
