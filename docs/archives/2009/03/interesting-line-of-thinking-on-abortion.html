<h1>Interesting line of thinking on abortion</h1>

<blockquote class="huff">There are people out there that effectively use abortion as their means of birth control. I used to hate the concept of this, and felt that there should be limitations on how many abortions someone can get to prevent this from happening. Then I thought about it further, especially with the insight I got from my partner, who worked at Planned Parenthood for a while.

<p>If someone is so irresponsible that they either will not use any other form of birth control even when it's offered to them for free, or they take it and can't seem to use it properly, what reason do we have to believe they will suddenly find that responsibility when they're denied the abortion and are forced to raise a child? Is it worth taking the chance that the child will be neglected, abused, or raised poorly by a known irresponsible adult in the hopes that it will teach them to take responsibility?</blockquote><a href="http://www.metafilter.com/80081/Witness-to-a-womb#2492000">Read full comment by evilangela on MetaFilter</a>.</p>
