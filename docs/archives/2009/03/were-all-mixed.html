<h1>We're all mixed</h1>

<p>I don't want to use the word racially sensitive to describe myself, but race issues swirl around me on a daily basis. Being of visibly mixed race, I'm constantly hit with novel approaches to race.</p>

<p>Some Filipinos treat me as one of their own. Others treat me as only partially one of their own. Some Filipinos are race-blind and don't care.</p>

<p>At Subway, the service staff talks to me in Spanish. At the dry cleaners, the older Hispanic ladies treat me as if I was their nephew. At Mexican restaurants, some customers give me puzzling looks as if to say, "is this guy Mexican?" Others just pass over me as if I blend in. When the waiter finds out I don't speak Spanish, he gives me a disappointed look as if I'm transgressing my heritage somehow. "Come on, don't you want tortillas?," he pleaded with me today.</p>

<p>An Indian girl once asked me if I was Indian. I said, "I'm half-Indian, half-Filipino." She replied with a strange look that I'll never forget and said, "Oh, that's cool, you know, to be unique and all." I could tell she was giving me a compliment out of sympathy. When she said that, it never occurred to me that I would feel like a mongrel or a mutt.</p>

<p>And it didn't bother me then and it still doesn't bother me. Sometimes my race works to my benefit, other times it doesn't. Sometimes I play it up, sometimes I don't. When I applied to colleges under the ethnicity box I checked "Other."</p>

<p>The overall theme/point I'm getting across is Mr. In-The-Middle. It seems that in our media all we hear are the two extremes of race-obsession. On one end, we have Mr. UR-WHITE MAN <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1155360/Clint-Eastwood-goes-gunning-PC-killjoys-saying-laugh-race-based-jokes.html">Clint Eastwood decrying how bad it is that we can't make racial jokes</a>. On the other end, we have the overly race-conscious types wondering aloud, "What does this mean? What does this mean?"</p>

<p>Some people are race-blind, others are race-conscious. Most of us are somewhere in the middle, i.e. mixed.<br />
