<h1>What about men?</h1>

<p><i>Note to fans of Philosophistry: this is one of <a href="http://hardtoremember.org/dlog/?file=pk920">the best drunk logs</a></i>.</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how the males of my generation respond to changing gender roles. These points have struck me the most:</p>

<p>First, I read somewhere that divorces are overwhelmingly (like 2-to-1) initiated by women.</p>

<p>Second, I read that men have historically rated "love" as a higher priority in determining who to marry, while as women have rated "security." This seems counter-intuitive since women seem to love Valentine's Day more than men. Or maybe it makes sense, because if your man loves you, then that really means he's here to stay.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I read recently that 40% of births last year were out-of-wedlock.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I realized that I've never heard anybody talk about marriage as way to make a strong commitment, and by doing so, create a solid foundation to start a family. I see marriage nowadays reduced to just another event in the long-line of give-and-take in any relationship. Someone just really wants it, and then someone finally caves in. Or as someone sarcastically put it, marriage is "<a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/113004/The-piece-of-paper-that-shows-you-care">the piece of paper that shows I care.</a>"</p>

<p>This points to men having a more tentative role, like simply providing the seed, maybe the alimony. A lot of the guys my age, who are peacocking with their hipster fashion, on some level just strike me as gigolos. Or maybe it points to a bigger emphasis on alpha males. We kind of already have a scientifically-moderated system for alpha males in the form of sperm donation. How does that fit into evolutionary psychology? I could go to a sperm bank today and duplicate my "going-to-the-sperm-bank" gene a thousand times over.</p>

<p>This isn't any one gender's fault really. After all, I imagine that deadbeat dads aren't a new phenomena, and there's a reason that 4 out of 5 times, the judge awards the children to the mother.</p>

<p>I'm of the philosophy that all patterns of gender conflict can boil down to women being able to produce a maximum of maybe 50 children, while as men can theoretically produce 3-9 children for every day of their life after puberty. Marriage, courtship, infidelity, and the notion of "fidelity" to begin with, all boil down to that.</p>

<p>But I still believe in love. Even if necessity is the mother of it.<br />
