<blockquote class="huff">"You don't have to be a music critic," says Seattle music critic and former Reader contributor Michaelangelo Matos, "to be breathing in more music than you can breathe out."

<p>...</p>

<p>"Music exploded over the past 20 years," Matos says. "The figure Robert Christgau likes to put out there is, 'There's twice as much music made per year than there are hours to listen to it.' This is pure conjecture on my part, but I would say that now it's actually more music made per month than you can listen to in a year." One thing's clear: if your music-consumption habits are dictated primarily by the amount of space left on your hard drive, your ears will never catch up with your collection.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>So he announced via a blog post in late December that he was going on a musical diet, which he calls Slow Listening in a nod to the Slow Food movement. For the first 11 months of 2009 he's holding himself to strict rules: "I'm only allowing myself to download one MP3 at a time," he writes at <a href="http://slowlisteningmovement.blogspot.com">slowlisteningmovement.blogspot.com</a>. The next MP3 can only be downloaded once he's listened to the current one. If he buys a CD, he must listen to it all the way through before he buys another</blockquote></p>
