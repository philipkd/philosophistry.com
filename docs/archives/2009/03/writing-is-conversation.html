<h1>Writing is conversation</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Monday Mar  9, 2009 10:44 AM

<p>The more and more I write, the more I find that my writing is an extended form of conversation.</p>

<p>I noticed today, for example, that I received a comment on one of my posts, and before I read the comment, I re-read my post first. And I didn't just re-read to remember what I wrote, but rather in order to make it seem like the post and comment were part of one continuous stream of conversation.</p>

<p>In 1999, a couple of technologists came together and wrote the "<a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>," which now, with blogs firmly entrenched and Twitter taking over, seems very prescient:<blockquote class="huff">A powerful global conversation has begun. Through the Internet, people are discovering and inventing new ways to share relevant knowledge with blinding speed. As a direct result, markets are getting smarter--and getting smarter faster than most companies.</blockquote><br />
<h2>Comments</h2><p>Mark said on April 25, 2009  8:29 PM: <p>A buck?  You're kidding, right?  For that little tiny tidbit?</p>

<p>It was interesting, but nothing more than a tease, an opening, a bare beginning.  There was not nearly enough of it to dignify it with the term "content".  </p>

<p>I would really have enjoyed reading more along the lines of that beginning.  But pay for that little bit?  I guess not!<br />
