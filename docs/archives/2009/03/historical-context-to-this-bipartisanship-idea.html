<h1>Historical context to this "bipartisanship" idea</h1>

<p>Just noticed this FOX Forum post by Richard Miller titled, <a href=http://foxforum.blogs.foxnews.com/2009/03/03/miller_limbaugh_steele/>Blaming Rush</a>, with this interesting assumption<blockquote class="huff">But in fairness to my few liberal friends, I should concede that there is nothing illegitimate about these efforts. Political parties aren't in the business of bipartisanship or creating even temporary across-the-aisle coalitions.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The historical reason for political parties is to emphasize the differences, not the similarities with the opposition. They must do so in order to retain, increase and exhort members.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><br />
Things weren't always like this. This, according to Hendrik Hertzberg's comment in <i>The New Yorker</i> titled, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2009/02/23/090223taco_talk_hertzberg">Partisanship, be the Bye</a>:<blockquote class="huff">McConnell's vision of "the Europeanization of America" has already come true in a way that bears directly on the question of "bipartisanship": what might be called America's parliamentary parties have come to resemble their disciplined European counterparts. As recently as the nineteen-sixties, for reasons of history and origins, <strong>the Democrats were a stapled-together collection of Southern reactionaries, big-city hacks, and urban and agrarian liberals; the Republicans were a jumble of troglodyte conservatives, Yankee moderates, and the odd progressive. Ideological incoherence made bipartisanship feasible.</strong> The post-civil-rights, post-Vietnam realignment, along with the gerrymandered creation of safe districts, has given us--on Capitol Hill, at least--an almost uniformly rightist G.O.P. and a somewhat less uniformly progressive array of Democrats.</p>

<p>In 1981, President Reagan's tax cuts passed with the help of forty-eight cross-party votes in the House and thirty-seven in the Senate. Obama's stimulus got zero and three, respectively.</blockquote></p>

I love it when just a quick dab of history changes perspectives. Bipartisanship is possible. Political pundits love stirring controversy by <i>daring</i> to encourage partisanship.<br />
