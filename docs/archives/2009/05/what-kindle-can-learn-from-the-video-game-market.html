<h1>What Kindle can learn from the video game market</h1>

<p>In video game parlance, a "console seller" is a video game that people want so badly that they'll buy a $200-$500 system just to get it. This is why console manufacturers clamor so much for exclusives. <i>Rock Band</i>, <i>Gears of War</i>, and <i>Halo</i> are all console sellers.</p>

<p>But what would be a "console seller" for Amazon's Kindle?</p>

<p>For me, I would fork the $489 to purchase a Kindle DX if they could give me a digital subscription to <i>The New Yorker</i> delivered right at midnight on Sundays. As it stands now, I get it in the mail three and a half days later at 1pm on Wednesday. Uncool. In the mean time, I hear the blogosphere abuzz with this article or that, and while I can read a third to half of the articles for free online, I refuse to subscribe to the RSS feeds or visit the home page, simply because I want to savor the magazine and have it exist in its own stream.</p>

<p>If Amazon made a deal with Conde Nast, that would change everything for me.</p>

<p>Then again, Amazon is in some ways already thinking about "console sellers." Actually, in computer electronics parlance, the term would be "killer app." Amazon made a deal with major textbook publishers to get their books on the Kindle DX. If I was still a student, I'd be begging my parents for this. The backpack load of an AP student in High School is ridiculous.<br />
