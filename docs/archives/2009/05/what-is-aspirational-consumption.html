<h1>What is aspirational consumption?</h1>

<p>I know about the term "conspicuous consumption." But I couldn't tell whether "aspirational consumption" was something Dana Goodyear made up, or is actually a real term.</p><p>Dana Goodyear has an <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_goodyear">interesting article about Fred Franzia</a>, who recently celebrated the sale of the four-hundred-millionth bottle of Charles Shaw, also known as Two Buck Chuck:<blockquote class="huff">The recession is likely to bring Franzia more customers. People are drinking more, and cheaper, wine; industry people call it "trading down," a sharp reversal after decades of aspirational consumption.</blockquote>That's the first time I heard the term "aspirational consumption." Fortunately I don't have to think anymore and can just Google it. Wikipedia has an interesting entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirational_brand">Aspirational brand</a>:<blockquote class="huff">As a general rule, an aspirational brand and its products can command a price premium in the marketplace over a commodity brand. This ability can to a large extent be explained by the consumer's need for invidious consumption for which he is willing to pay a premium. The smaller the size of the product's target audience compared to the exposure audience, the more the product satisfies this need, and the higher the premium that such a consumer is prepared to pay.</blockquote><img src="../../scans/2009/05/aspirational.png"><br />
