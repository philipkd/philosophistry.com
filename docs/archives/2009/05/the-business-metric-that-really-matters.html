<h1>The business metric that really matters</h1>

<p>One of my pet peeves in mainstream financial journalism is the obsession over large companies. While it's meaningful in a superficial sense (in that more power is now concentrated in one entity), it means jack-sh** for employees or our collective moral well-being. We don't need bigger companies. We need to focus on this instead:</p><p><img src="../../scans/2009/05/profit-per-head.png"></p>

<p>(<a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/05/14/congratulations-google-staff-210k-in-profit-per-head-in-2008/">Link</a> via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/05/17/profit-per-head">Gruber</a>.)</p>

<p>I also like this other article Gruber linked to: <a href="http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/nintendo-makes-more-per-employee-than-google-goldman-sachs/?biz=1">Nintendo Makes More Per Employee than Google, Goldman Sachs</a>.</p>

<p>What's really sad, and proof that the Japanese workingman has his head in the sand, is the following:<blockquote class="huff">Before tax and before pay, the average Goldman employee generated $1.24m in profit last year, based on the company's accounts. But after Nintendo upgraded its earnings forecast recently, the FT estimates each staff member will produce more than $1.6m in profit this year. ... While Nintendo employees are generating a ton of profit for their company, compensation for these workers pales in comparison to those who are employed by Goldman Sachs. The average salary at Nintendo was just $90,900, while Nintendo's big windfall goes to shareholders. Goldman Sachs employees earned about $660,000 in 2007 - which is roughly half the profit they generated.</blockquote>That American compensation scheme is whack too, though.<br />
