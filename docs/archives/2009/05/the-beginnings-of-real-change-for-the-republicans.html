<h1>The beginnings of real change for the Republicans</h1>

<p>On Talk Radio and FOX News there's this back-and-forth about whether the GOP needs to "evolve," "expand its base," "do more of what it does best," or "do soul-searching." But what it really needs to do is so simple and obvious:</p><blockquote class="huff">California Representative Kevin McCarthy, the chief recruiter for House Republicans, said he wants his party to <b>select candidates based less on ideology and more on their chances of winning</b>. The goal, he said, is to seek out prospects who are ethnically diverse, female, less partisan and even supportive of abortion rights. So far, these efforts are more concept than reality.

<p>Emanuel, a former U.S. representative from Illinois, put the template into practice in 2006 when he was leading the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Candidates he recruited won in Republican districts by holding positions uncommon for Democrats such as opposition to abortion and support for gun rights.</blockquote>(from <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/bloomberg/ab2p31qrjh6k">Republicans Adopt Emanuel's Tactics to Deliver 2010 'Thumpin"</a>)</p>

<p>Underdog parties naturally bounce back not because the core of their party finds some new resonant message or leadership, but rather simply because new members with new demographics join the party to fill out the ranks.<br />
