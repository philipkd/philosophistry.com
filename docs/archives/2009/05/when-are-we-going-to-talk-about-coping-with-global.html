<h1>When are we going to talk about coping with Global Warming?</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Friday May 29, 2009  1:28 PM 
<br><a href="/archives/mainfeed.html">mainfeed</a>, <a href="/archives/third_way_thinking.html">third way thinking</a></h2>

<p>We mature intellectually when we contemplate unthinkable scenarios.</p><p>I like the way <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/01/25/the_other_global_warming/?page=full">this one article from boston.com</a> starts:<blockquote class="huff">Human civilization will heat up the planet.</blockquote>The rest of the paragraph ultimately talks about ways to prevent warming. But without the context, that sentence just seems like a blunt fact, and one that I believe.</p>

<p>I'm sensing that global warming skepticism has finally gone passe. Maybe it's because Bush isn't in charge. Either way, I don't hear the voices of skepticism in power anymore.</p>

<p>Having said that, when will we start talking about what to do in the event that Global Warming takes place? Are we prepared for it? Do we have disaster prepardness funds in place for an accelerating pace of Katrina's? Should we be creating a Noah's Ark to respond to the mass extinction we're causing?</p>

<p>While the "inconvenient truth" of global warming is finally sinking in to the hold-outs, when will the environmentalists contemplate the inconvenient truth that we don't have enough collectivist willpower to adequately prevent global warming?<br />

<p>Think again. Current polls show that concern over "Global Warming" is down considerably since 2007. And even fewer people place it a high priority for government action.</p>

<p>The saddest thing about "Global Warming" is that there hasn't been a serious debate about it. Those who question it are demonized. Remember: it's dangerous to fall in love with your conceptual models.</p></p>

<p><a title="http://www.philosophistry.com/" href="http://www.philosophistry.com/" rel="nofollow">Philip Dhingra</a> said on June  3, 2009  1:12 AM: <p>I think this idea also has potential implications for the GOP. If the Democrats are truly serious about the global warming threat, they would be talking about prevention AND coping. If you challenge the Dems to spend money on coping and they won't, then you can speculate, "well, then you don't take it as seriously as you claim you do."</p></p>

Setting all of that aside, let's assume the earth will warm by a few degrees in the next century:  I have yet to see (or even envision how one would go about) a model which shows that has a net bad outcome.</p>

<p>That is to say, some places will suffer drought, but others will gain needed moisture.  Some places will flood while farming spreads North in Canada and Russia...etc.</p></p>

The US, Canada, and Russia are eying that trading zone with deep interest.</p></p>
