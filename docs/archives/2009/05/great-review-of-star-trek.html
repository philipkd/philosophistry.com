<h1>Great review of Star Trek</h1>

<p>Star Trek. Star Trek. Star Trek. It's cracked what, 95% on Rotten Tomatoes now. It's certainly the movie of the moment. I want to use this opportunity to continue my campaign to promote The New Yorker.</p><p>Anthony Lane clears the back pages of <i>The New Yorker</i> to give a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2009/05/18/090518crci_cinema_lane?currentPage=all">two-page review of Star Trek</a>. Though not providing a glowing review, Lane still "nails it" with his observational wit.<br />
<blockquote class="huff">I thoroughly approved of his bedding an extraterrestrial female with green skin, eco-sex being all the rage two centuries from now.</blockquote>When describing the Romulan (bad guy) space ship the <i>Narada</i>:<br />
<blockquote class="huff">Looks like a dozen Philippe Starck lemon squeezers clumped together and dipped in squid ink.</blockquote>I didn't even know what a Philippe Starck lemon squeezer was, but I immediately got the image in my mind.</p>

<p>Philippe Starck lemon squeezer:</p>

<p>Fan rendering of the <i>Narada</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="huff">Similarly, our heroes keep clinging to brinks by their fingertips, as if to prove that a proper cliffhanger needs a genuine cliff.</blockquote>I watched Star Trek a second time and didn't realize that Kirk is literally in a cliff-hanger four times.<blockquote class="huff">On the other hand, it does mean that we get more of Zachary Quinto, whose very name sounds like the sacred text of a superior race, and who, in his role as the youthful Spock, is the most commanding reason to see this film. He alone prepares the gray matter. Bowie-thin, solemn but not humorless, tacitly quoting Sherlock Holmes, and nipping around like a sixties groover in his skintight costume, he wipes the floor with Kirk, while making time for a Vulcanizing smooch with Lieutenant Uhura (ZoÃ« Saldana), the resident linguist, who is said to have "exceptional oral sensitivity."</blockquote>Zachary Quinto is now <i>the</i> man of the hour. As he's been described on Facebook, "Spock is hottt!"
