<p>One introspective thread I like running is seeing how my attitude toward the youth changes over time. When I was a teenager, I promised myself to not fall into the generational cycle of being offended by the youth. At the time, I felt that it was a law of nature that the youth will always find a way to make their parents' tempers boil. For the 60s, it was free sex and drugs. For the 90s and 00s it's being too sad or apathetic.</p>

<p>At 26, I've come to realize why this cycle is so indelible. I think it's genetic. I notice I have a physical reaction to hearing about things like, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_party_(sexuality)">rainbow parties</a>" (good new expression: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic">moral panic</a>) and I was greatly relieved to know that they might be fake. And then I started to wonder about whether I was open-minded enough.</p>

<p>On the flipside, I was really sick the past couple days, and I felt like I was 89 years old. And to make myself feel better, I tried to fill my mind with positive thoughts, and a common image I focused in on was the vigor of the youth. I thought about LeBron James, Scarlett Johansson, Novak Djokovic (tennis), and even Barack Obama. Oddly enough, I was even grateful for the Jonas Brothers, who I know nothing about except that they wear purity rings. In my mind, I'm like, "Yes, the kids are going to be alright!" Which I found odd given <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/19/us/19purity.html">how weird that whole business seems</a> to me.<br />
