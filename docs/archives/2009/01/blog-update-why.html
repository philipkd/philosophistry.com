<h1>Blog Update: Why so many posts today?</h1>

<p>I debated putting this out there.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I've sort of put aside, at least a year ago, crazy frenzy posting as a rule, simply because I'd do it for one day, and then stop. Usually the crazy volume would be prompted by a new way of thinking about my blog. For example, I had an idea once that, "what if I made my site like <a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Kottke.org</a>." When I got that idea in my head, I posted like crazy for a day, thinking I had found <i>my</i> format. Somehow I believe I can really aid the explosure [neo-sic] of this site if I just find the right format. Oh, an even better example are the 12 posts I made over a week on <a href="/archives/secular_religion.html">secular religion</a>. That idea was based the notion, "well, what if I stuck to one topic, pre-set the length of each post (between 1 and 5 paragraphs)" The idea was that I could somehow compile everything together and bind it like a book, a la Nietzsche's <i>Gay Science</i> (yeah yeah, how dare I compare myself to the great Nietzsche).</p>

<p>In the mean time, over the past two years or so, I've abandoned certain kinds of posts, in particular, posts like this one. The point of <i>that</i> process was an idea, "what if I slowly evolved my blog, and maybe 5-10 years from now, it really takes off." Clearly the subtext in all of this is an embarrassingly intense desire for success channeled in a way that would contradict my tech-start-up pedigree.</p>

<p>Also, there's a fear that whenever I do these things, I look back a couple days later, and think, "yet another abandoned epiphany." It almost looks like clinical logorrhea, where I'm having some sort of neurosis-inspired talkativity [sic]. I might be. Actually, I feel fine and I'm sort of relishing dancing this psychotic-looking dance.</p>

<p>So, sorry to drag you through so many digressions. What's behind the frenzy today?</p>

<p><i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i>.</p>

<p>When reading that book and reading Viktor Frankl's <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i>, the question always lurking in the back of your mind is, "Well, what's the author's damned purpose!" Clearly, both their purposes is to help others find purpose. How convenient.</p>

<p>So, I'll quit beating around the bush, and tell you what purpose I decided I'm here for: change people's lives, inspire people, open eyes, awaken people, move them, create epiphanies.... to the best of my abilities.</p>

<p>And I committed that purpose to writing a couple days ago, and the whole idea has been recycling in my head like a broken record. I've been repeating a mantra in my head at least a thousand times, "I'm here to inspire others, to change lives!" It's very loud, so much so that I feel a little disassociated from myself.</p>

<p>In the process, I've come up with different directions for this site that have me extremely inspired, as inspired as I felt when I first started writing.</p>

<p>Having said that. I really hope I don't look back at this post a couple weeks from now and think to myself, "ah geez, yet another false-start epiphany." But alas, it does take some courage to go ahead anyways and post this, commit it to the public. I mean, part of the plan is to let myself write in this kind of manner, rather than in my wannabe New Yorker, professionalish voice.</p>
