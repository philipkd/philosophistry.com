<h1>Some parts of the Purpose-Driven Life feel like Xanax</h1>

<p>Last night, I read "Day 4: Made to Last Forever," in the <i>Purpose-Driven Life</i>, and it felt like I was taking Xanax (an anti-anxiety pill).</p>

<p>BTW, I'm an atheist, which makes this all the more interesting.</p>

<p>Before that, in the afternoon, I found myself really anxious about my work options, and I could see my whole evening already laid out: me lying on my bed, analyzing myself to death. I tried everything from "thinking positive" to "bearing the pain" to "working through the anxiety" etc., but nothing seemed to work. I then took a sort of random, maybe from-left-field course of action: continue through <i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i>.</p>

<p>The question at the end of "Day 4" is "Since I was made to last forever, what is the one thing I should stop doing and the one thing I should start doing today?" And so I opened up Notepad and typed in my response to that question. Go ahead, try it. It takes 5 minutes. Here, I'll make it easy for you:</p>

<p><textarea rows="20" cols="80"></textarea></p>

<p>After going through the process of imagining me in an afterlife for eternity, and then speculating about what that might mean, I felt this wave of muscle-relaxation come over my body. The gist of what <i>I</i> wrote down was that I would stop trying so hard. There's maybe three major areas of my life where I feel like I'm just treading water. I find myself really stubborn about aspects of my life. "My life has to be this way!" "Letting go of this would be unacceptable!" But cast in the light of eternity, I asked myself, "What if it's not unacceptable?" "Why don't you cut yourself some slack?" The attitude I felt was that, if I knew I was going to live forever after death, then really I should just be focused on "getting through" my life on earth, rather than trying to make a big deal about so much trivial crap. It seems like the kind of attitude that would also be useful if you were stuck in jail: "Just get through this."</p>

<p>I just really like the idea that five pages of rhetoric can cause the same physical impact that a Xanax would.</p>
