<h1>One of the blogosphere's best kept secrets: Brand New</h1>

<p>I had 25 unread items in my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, and I was about to click "Mark All As Read," when I noticed myself zooming in on one item. It was a post on <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/">Brand New</a>, a blog that does before-and-after analysis of logos. Noticing my behavior made me realize that Brand New is one of the blogosphere's best kept secrets.</p>

<p>One of their best articles is their <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/brand_new_best_worst_2008.php">Best & Worst of 2008 roundup</a>.</p>

<p>It's really cool to see how logos evolve. I think it's the same feeling I get when I see the evolution of Homer Simpson:</p>

<p>Often companies keep their logo design changes quiet, so as not to disrupt their brand value. Brand New, therefore, sort of has a constant "gotcha moment" for style. It's like how we never really imagine current fashion as on-the-way-to-retro. For example, wearing bell bottoms in the 70s and 80s just looked "good" at the time, while as now it's associated with a certain attitude, like blaxploitation funk. Likewise, 10 years from now our logosphere will be substantially different, and yet we won't have noticed the change.</p>

<p>Someone once said that architecture is the most important art form, because we experience it everyday. But I wonder if nowadays, it's logos. I wonder if the average person knows more logos than words. (Here's a fun link to a <a href="http://www.2jdhosting.com/ge/logogame/index.php">guess-that-logo game</a>).</p>
