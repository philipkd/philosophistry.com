<h1>Panaceas are the Holy Grail in life-change</h1>

<p>I have a belief, either rational or irrational, that panaceas exist for improving the quality of your life. A panacea is defined as "A remedy for all diseases, evils, or difficulties; a cure-all." While there technically can't be a solution to all our problems, people seem to find things that certainly feel like panaceas.</p>

<p>This has basis in anecdote. The most classic examples come from the domain of religion. The concrete examples I can conjure are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Milvian_Bridge">Constanine's Vision</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_substance_abuse_controversy">George W. Bush becoming Born Again</a>. We seem to hear, all the time, of people whose lives become irrevocably changed through a religious awakening.</p>

<p>Examples also come from the secular domain. I'm recalling this report from someone <a href="http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=61025">who discovered St. John's Wort; An Astoundingly Improved Life</a>:<blockquote>I really can't believe how I could have suffered from depression for years and a great help was sitting next to the Tylenol in the grocery store and cost about 10 cents per capsule. There isn't a 'cure' for depression in anything or anyone, but for me this has been an amazing way to help control and dramatically improve my everyday life. If I had only have found this 4 or 5 years ago... but since I can't go back in time I'm just glad I discovered it when I did.</blockquote>You also hear of people who have been dramatically changed by a psychiatrist, movie, or weekend retreat. This <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/14668/">one thread on MetaFilter</a> asks "Life-altering experiences. Can you point to a single experience in your life, as a child, which you can define as having contributed to the person you are today?"</p>

<p>I wish there was a good study on game-changers in people's lives. Perhaps it's a really tough problem to unravel. How do you identify "dramatic life-change?" And how do you isolate the method. It seems that people's lives can be changed by simply listening to an album. For other people, a year of tending to someone who is dying will do the trick.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm constantly on the hunt for this panacea. I can think of at least 50 times when I thought I had found a panacea, but only, a few weeks later, find that the change was only superficial. This is why I'm reading <i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i>. Hopefully one day I'll find my panacea(s) and be able to share it with others.</p>

<p>(I'm also aware that fantasizing about panaceas may be a symptom of another problem, or it may be a cause of problems, in of itself).</p>
