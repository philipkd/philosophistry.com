<p>Who says we don't have free will?</p>

<p>(Sort of in increasing order of level of commitment) </p>

<p>A thought comes to your mind, "I want to exercise more"</p>

<p>A thought comes to your mind, "I need to exercise more"</p>

<p>A thought comes to your mind, "I need to exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>A thought comes to your mind, "I will exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>You make an effort to say, in your mind, "I will exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>You make an effort to say, in your mind, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>You make an effort to say, in your mind, on New Year's Day, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>You say, aloud, to yourself, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>You say, aloud, with one other person hearing, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>You say, aloud, in a group setting, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>You write down on a piece of paper, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009" but you throw the paper away later</p>

<p>You write on your blog, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009"</p>

<p>You write down on a piece of paper, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009" and you tape the paper to your computer</p>

<p>You write down on a piece of paper, "My New Year's Resolution is to exercise more in 2009" and you keep it in your wallet<br />
