<h1>Going to town with repeating expressions</h1>

<p>This is now the sixth post in 15 days where I use the expression, "go to town." Does anybody else do that? Where you take up an expression, and pepper it into your conversations for like a month.</p>

<p>Peppering. That's a good one.</p>

<p>Expression. That's another good one.</p>

<p>Actually, George W. Bush kept saying <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/1/12/102257/635/306/683112">klieg lights</a> over the span of a couple of weeks recently:<blockquote class="huff">"When I get out of here, I am getting off the stage," he said. "I have had my time in the Klieg lights."</blockquote><br />
I know he said it on his final press conference and during an TV interview recently. It was a very noticeable word usage, totally out of character for Bush. He's never used a word before that I had to look up. Here's the definition for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klieg_light">klieg light</a>:<blockquote class="huff">A powerful carbon-arc lamp producing an intense light and used especially in making movies.</blockquote><br />
I've been saying "go to town" a bunch this month in general. But here are the six references:<ul><li>this post<br />
<li><a href="/archives/2009/01/purposefully_impossible_mission_statement.html">"It wasn't until I had a public forum to post my ideas, that I really went to town."</a><br />
<li><a href="/archives/2009/01/wikipedia_gems_heaven_and_hell.html">"I really just like the way wikipedia goes to town on the entries..."</a><br />
<li><a href="/archives/2009/01/the_two_fs_of_lucid_dreaming.html">"I wanted to be confident I was dreaming before going to town with the world, Grand Theft Auto-style."</a><br />
<li><a href="/archives/2009/01/the_hudson_river_plane_crash_and_the_dimming_congregation_effect_of_media.html">"My favorite blogger, Jason Kottke, went to town on the whole thing"<br />
<li><a href="/archives/2009/01/secular_religion_what_did_the_greeks_call_zeus.html">"An anthropologist or sociologist could go to town with trying to classify the varieties of religious attitudes."</a></ul></p>

<p>In <a href="archives/2009/01/purposefully_impossible_mission_statement.html">the previous post</a> I used the expression "take a page from," which I like. I think I might "run with it."<br />
