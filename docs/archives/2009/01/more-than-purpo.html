<h1>More than purpose</h1>

<p>"There's more to my life than purpose."</p>

<p>That was a quieter mantra that rang in my head as I was going through the mania of <i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i>. In reading that book, I felt I was buckling under the weight of a giant orb, dominating 95% of my thoughts with "this is what I was meant to do."</p>

<p>But really, regardless of what your purpose in life is, I think it's common sense that there's more to life than your mission. Happiness and feeling good are important ends, in of themselves. And so spending my whole Sunday reading <i>Twilight</i> instead of doing something useful for the world, is a good thing.</p>

<p>I think it's just interesting that a statement like "there's more to my life than purpose," would actually have an impact to someone in the throes of <i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i>. I feel that some purpose-driven diehards might even react negatively to that sentence, maybe even rebutting, "like what??"</p>
