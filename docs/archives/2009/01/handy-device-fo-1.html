<h1>Handy Device for Creativity: The Ball of Whacks</h1>

<p>If you haven't checked out <a href="http://www.creativewhack.com/home.php?cat=1">Roger von Oech's creativity products</a> before, they are a must buy. I'd especially recommend the Creative Whack Pack, which I've used regularly since 1998 to help get me unstuck.</p>

<p>I just got one of his newest products, the <a href="http://www.creativewhack.com/product.php?productid=10">Ball of Whacks</a>, and it's really cool. Basically, it's a bunch of pyramids with magnets that you can then build interesting shapes with. By keeping this on my desk, I found an interesting, maybe unintended, side effect.</p>

<p>What I do is shape the object gradually throughout the day. I'll move a piece here and there, bit by bit, every couple hours or so without thinking. When I leave my desk and come back, it kind of strikes me with a question, "why did I make that shape? what does it say about my psyche." For example, I came back today, and saw it in this kind of chaotic, pointed monster shape:</p>

<p><br />
This made me think to myself, am I in a thorny state of mind right now? Probably if I saw the whacks shaped like the following, I'd imagine I was in some sort of harmonious or calm state:</p>

<p><br />
Or, maybe this projection represents a state that I'm trying to reach. If it's pointed, then it suggests I'm seeking increased activity and disorder. If it's cohesive, maybe I'm seeking harmony. Either way, I like the idea of getting pleasantly surprising feedback about my state of mind. I used to, for example, make one random abstract expressionist sketch each day, and then look back and try to psychoanalyze myself.</p>

<p><i>Disclosure: I'm consulting with Roger currently, but I decided to post this on my own.</i></p>
