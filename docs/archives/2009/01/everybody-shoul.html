<p>Reading Julia Cameron's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585420093?ie=UTF8&tag=philosophistr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1585420093">The Right to Write</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=philosophistr-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1585420093" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is interesting because of all the different angles at which she tries to jostle readers into just picking up a pen and writing.</p>

<p>One of the interesting angles is that she talks about how <i>everybody</i> is a writer. Everybody thinks, has ideas, and wants to express their ideas.</p>

<p>Which has got me thinking that if you take an inventory of skills in a career-finding test, there will be a subset of these skills that belong in the "everybody is" category.</p>

<p>I can think of a couple off the top of my head.</p>

<p>"everybody is a singer"</p>

<p>Everybody wants to sing, and enjoys singing (barring physical handicap). If they're bad, they like to sing in the shower. I think that's largely the appeal of American Idol. (And now in the US, karaoke).</p>

<p>Here's another one.</p>

<p>"everybody is an entrepreneur"</p>

<p>I believe that everybody has had a moment like, "somebody should fix this" or "somebody should offer this." I think I'd feel comfortable going on a crusade to have everybody, and I mean everybody, try creating a start-up. I feel like that would be a universal good.</p>

<p>A cynic could say, "well, not everybody has good ideas, the world doesn't need more half-baked ideas." I think that would be B.S. because we don't know which ideas are half-baked and which ideas are not until they're attempted. I've had a lot of start-ups ask me to do things which looked ridiculous on paper, but once fully expressed became a "why didn't I think of this."</p>

<p>A lot of good companies started in downturns. GE, Disney, HP, Hyatt, Microsoft, FedEx, MTV, CNN.</p>
