<h1>Shouldn't the aesthetics of a word's letterforms affect the connotation of what is denoted?</h1>

<p>My friend, who's one of the best hackers in the world, is a very logical-minded person. He's an atheist, doesn't believe in anything supernatural, and has a no-fuss, no-nonsense character. Which is why I was surprised when I suggested that people's personalities are shaped by their names. He agreed, "If you hear your name 10,000+ times in your life, the way it sounds and what it means are going to have a big impact on you."</p>

<p>Similarly, I believe the aesthetics of words, when written down, also contribute to how often those words are used and what connotations they have. For fun, I ranked the capital letterforms in Times New Roman in order of their beauty:</p><p><img src="../../scans/2009/12/goodgroup.gif"></p>

<p>Of the good group, <b>A</b> strikes a great pose. Everything about its pinnacle shape says <i>alpha</i> (in an alpha-and-omega sense) and <i>authority</i>. <b>M</b> is also a top letterform, conjuring up <i>magisterial</i>. Its <i>mirrored</i> towers are similar to shapes that symbolize balance and justice in Tarot. <b>G</b> is a <i>grand</i> figure and it reminds me of the jawline and beard of a Lionhearted king. <b>D</b> is like a clean, balanced blade. <b>O</b> screams purity, Earth, and ideal forms. <b>Z</b> is like a laser <i>zipping</i> through space. <b>H</b> <i>holds</i> itself together in a sturdy shape. <b>V</b> is as good of a representation of sharpness as you can get.</p>

<p><br />

<p>The medium group starts with <b>S</b>, a decent, <i>slick</i> form. <b>K</b> is a sharp object striking a flat surface. <b>T</b> stands <i>tall</i> as a proud <i>tower</i>. <b>Q</b> gets points for being the <i>quirkiest</i> letterform. <b>N</b> shares a lot of the same qualities as "Z", but is a tad dull. <b>X</b> is so much an <i>exemplar</i> of <i>expressive</i> letterform that it often feels overplayed. <b>R</b> has a nice <i>regal</i> quality, like a courtier leaning on one leg, with his cape wrapped around his bent arm. <b>C</b> is a good, solid <i>curve</i>. And <b>F</b>, well at least it's not "E".</p>

<p><br />

<p>The last group is a rogues gallery of misshapen letters. <b>Y</b> is just not as cool as "V". <b>P</b> always looks ready to fall flat. What is <b>E</b>? Its two boxes stacked on top of each other are as boring as a factory. <b>U</b> is what, a cup? Cups are worthless. <b>L</b> is simple, but dull, as opposed to "O" which is simple, but ideal. <b>W</b> seems like a <i>wanna-be</i> "V" or like <i>wings</i> that never took off. <b>I</b> is thoughtless. <b>B</b> signifies an obese <i>body</i> or fat <i>buttocks</i>. And poor <b>J</b> is like an "I" with a dongle at the end of it. It looks ready to topple over.</p>

<p>Remember those large illustrated books that you read as a kid that had different animals associated with each letter? Perhaps this post comes from that same spirit.<br />
