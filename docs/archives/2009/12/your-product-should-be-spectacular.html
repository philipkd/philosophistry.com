<h1>Your product should be spectacular</h1>

<p>If Seth Godin's keyword is "extraordinary," how about I make mine, "spectacular." In particular, somehow make your product both a spectacle and usable.</p>

<p>Take for example <i>Beatles Rock Band</i>. I like how Harmonix spared no expense to re-create the rockstar experience. They could have easily given you a three-dollar mic the size of a toothbrush (like predecessors in the past), but instead they give you a sturdy-looking mic, a solid mic stand, and a shiny beautiful guitar. In other words, they added every little touch necessary to make their product <i>cause a scene</i> every time it's used.</p>

<p>All this equipment requires a big box, and as a result, the case is also an extension of the spectacle of the product. I was carrying this box down three flights of escalators in the mall a few days ago, and realized that that was the most effective advertisement ever. They should just pay people to wander the mall with one of those boxes&mdash;much more effective than an ad buy. I made so many parents mad, because as soon as I passed by their kids, they had to fend off cries of, "Ooh, Daddy look at <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>Same with the iPhone. Same with the Motorola Droid. You want to build products that make other people want to say, "Hey, let me see that."<br />
