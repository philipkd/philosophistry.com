<h1>Two Takeaways from Stephen King's On Writing</h1>

<p>I'm re-discovering Stephen King's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743455967/philosophistr-20/ref=nosim/">On Writing</a>. I had previously ignored it because in the Amazon excerpts, you start from the first half of the book, which is just a biography. The second half is where the fun is, where he talks about his philosophy of writing. I've just started the book, but I've already taken two good takeaways:</p>

<p><b>Read what you want to write</b> - Stephen King would count himself a believer in the idea that you can't be a good writer if you're not a good reader. I wasn't sure about this before, but his vote plus my own personal experience seems to corroborate that. When I read lots of fiction, fiction-writing seems to spring out of me. When I read a piece in the New Yorker, I want to write something non-fiction (like how I just read a New Yorker article 10 minutes ago). It makes sense. Wrapping yourself in reading switches your brain into participating in the conversation of that kind of medium.</p>

<p><b>You can't make bad writers good. And you can't make good writers great. But you can make competent writers good</b> - I think that's some cold, but straight talk. You can't pretend talent isn't a major factor. At the same time, you can't be hopeless and think you won't ever reach a point where you get be publishable. I sometimes measure myself by the standards of the greats, thinking, "Well, my work isn't nowhere near as good as Gladwell, I'll never become a writer," and then I slump in my chair.</p>

<p>I'm only partially through the actual On Writing section, but I want to read the rest of it.<br />
