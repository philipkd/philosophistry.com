<h1>20 Things I Like About the Droid</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Friday Nov 20, 2009  3:31 AM

<p>I'm an <a href="http://nuclearelements.com/">iPhone developer</a> based in Austin, TX who has had apps on the App Store since Day One. With the mounting negative buzz about the iPhone (like <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/11/joe-hewitt-developer-of-facebooks-massively-popular-iphone-app-quits-the-project/">Joe Hewitt quitting the iPhone</a>) and the glowing reviews of the Droid (like from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/18/verizon-droid-is-the-real-deal/">Michael Arrington of TechCrunch</a>), I decided to switch my main phone to a Droid. It also helps that clients have been begging me to make Android apps. I'm still developing primarily for the iPhone, but I <i>love</i> the Droid (and implicitly Android) now. I don't see why Android can't be The Next Big Thing.</p>

<p>I've been keeping track of the little things (and sometimes big things) that I like about it. I'm sure this list will keep expanding:</p>

<p>I like...</p>

<p><i>(Droid-Specific)</i><ol><li>the physical keyboard<br />
<li>the built-in sounds...esp. the "Drrooid" sound.<br />
<li>that my camera has a flash<br />
<li>the little flashing light at the top when there's a new notification<br />
<li>the rubber backing<br />
<li>the style of the hardware&mdash;more modern, more masculine.<br />
</ol><i>(Android-Specific)</i><ol><li value=7>the abundance of apps that modify fundamental phone behavior, like blocking/routing calls, upgrading voicemail<br />
<li>Google Sky (Android only)<br />
<li>that when I plug in the USB, my computer doesn't have a mini seizure (instead I choose to mount the drive)<br />
<li>that my camera app has built-in digicam settings, like white balance, color effects, etc.<br />
<li>the "SD Card" file management, as opposed to the walled garden of iTunes<br />
<li>that my browser remembers my passwords (w/o having to download a separate app)<br />
<li>having a separate Gmail app with tray notifications<br />
<li>the tray notification system (a major improvement over apple's icon number notifications)<br />
<li>widgets (weather, calendar)<br />
<li>the clarity of surfing the web with bigger screen resolution<br />
<li>the white text on black background styling&mdash;seems more modern<br />
<li>that I have a free Car Nav system now<br />
<li>that everybody's Google Talk icons are associated with my contacts<br />
<li>that everything "just works" with my Googlized digital life</ol>In many ways, the things I like about the Droid are the same things you'd like about having a jailbroken iPhone. There's, of course, many negative things about the Droid, but I'm not trying to make a balanced review here. Here's my executive summary: The Droid has next year's tech, but lacks Apple's polish.<br />
