<h1>Double standards about sexual "accomplishments"</h1>

<p>There's this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/a4gls/she_was_saying_how_its_unfair_that_if_a_girl/">amazing thread on reddit</a> that stirred up a tense gender relations flame war. Here's the trigger:<blockquote class="huff">I just had an argument with a girl I know. She was saying how it's unfair that if a guy fucks a different girl every week, he's a legend, but if a girl fucks just two guys in a year, she's a slut. So in response I told her that if a key opens lots of locks, then it's a master key. But if a lock is opened by lots of keys, then it's a shitty lock. That shut her up.</blockquote>There's both a lot of thoughtful and sexist comments in that thread. Most of the comments are simply funny, though:<blockquote class="huff">where can i meet some shitty locks</blockquote>But I want to highlight my rejoinder:<blockquote class="huff">Flip it around.<p/>I think it's unfair that a celibate man is called a nerd, dork, lameass, anti-social, "virgin" (negative tone) etc., while a celibate woman is called innocent, chaste, pure, "virgin" (positive tone).<p/>EDIT: I want to also throw in there that women are called "good" girls for remaining chaste. While as men are referred to "bad boys" (with positive connotations) for being pimps, studs, playas... whores.</blockquote><br />
