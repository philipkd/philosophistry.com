<h1>How to make an honest opinion about Bing</h1>

<p>So I made Bing my default search engine for a week, and thank God it's Monday. The most compelling reason to switch back to Google is because Google Maps is so much better. I'd often type in a query like "Chipotle Austin, TX" in Bing and not see results that I knew were definitely here. Or if they were here, I'd have to use a few more clicks on Bing to zoom into the view I really wanted. Having said this, though, my verdict is not statistically sound enough for me.</p><p>Fortunately, I just found out about <a href="http://blindsearch.fejus.com/">BlindSearch</a>. It conducts your searches in Yahoo, Google, and Bing and presents the results in a randomized 3-column layout with all the engine's brand cruft scratched out. On the first search I did, for <a href="http://blindsearch.fejus.com/?q=philosophistry">philosophistry</a>, I voted for the Bing version! (via <a href="http://waxy.org/links/">waxy</a>)</p>

<p>I decided to renew my 1-week experiment with Bing by making BlindSearch my default search engine. To make this happen in Firefox, I'm using this add-on: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3682">Add to Search Bar</a>.<br />
<h2>Comments</h2><p><a title="http://www.jsbaxter.com.au" href="http://www.jsbaxter.com.au" rel="nofollow">John</a> said on August  2, 2009  4:48 AM: <p>Just did a few queries and voted: Google 5, Yahoo 1, Bing 0.</p>

<p>Mind you, Bing was very close to Google in all of those, except the one Yahoo won, in which it returned an error - 'free porn'.  (Yahoo was otherwise a distant third. And I double-checked, bing.com will indeed return results for 'free porn' - if anything better than the others.)</p>

<p>I didn't get around to testing 'alternative word' issues (Google's annoying trend towards predicting what you meant to type), also the site can't handle local-specificity (which means a lot here in Australia - and Google does very well at).</p></p>
