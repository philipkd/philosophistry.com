<p>I tuned into conservative talk radio yesterday, and they played small snippets of Obama to make it seem like his whole Mideast trip was to apologize for America. I think they totally distorted Obama's message, and so I edited Obama's Cairo speech to present his trip in a different light.</p><p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/xgrJqNS9MPM&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/xgrJqNS9MPM&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br />

<p>One thought: Why is it that whenever I watch Barry give a speech, I feel like I'm at a tennis match?</p>

<p>Here's a couple of thoughts from Mark Steyn: http://www.ocregister.com/articles/world-muslim-president-2446787-obama-one</p>

<p>"The speech nevertheless impressed many conservatives, including Rich Lowry, my esteemed editor at National Review, "esteemed editor" being the sort of thing one says before booting the boss in the crotch. Rich thought that the president succeeded in his principal task: "Fundamentally, Obama's goal was to tell the Muslim world, 'We respect and value you, your religion and your civilization, and only ask that you don't hate us and murder us in return.'" But those terms are too narrow. You don't have to murder a guy if he preemptively surrenders. And you don't even have to hate him if you're too busy despising him. The savvier Muslim potentates have no desire to be sitting in a smelly cave in the Hindu Kush, sharing a latrine with a dozen half-witted goatherds while plotting how to blow up the Empire State Building. Nevertheless, they share key goals with the cave dwellers â€“ including the wish to expand the boundaries of "the Muslim world" and (as in the anti-blasphemy push at the U.N.) to place Islam, globally, beyond criticism. The nonterrorist advance of Islam is a significant challenge to Western notions of liberty and pluralism."</p></p>

At the same time, it would be hard to see a "Buddhist World" or a "Hindu World" conference.</p></p>
<p><a title="http://www.philosophistry.com/" href="http://www.philosophistry.com/" rel="nofollow">Philip</a> said on June  6, 2009  5:19 PM: <p>I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "tennis match," though. Is that referring to how he speeches don't stick to a single message, but rather wander between opposing points of views?</p></p>
<p>The Transcendent One said on June  6, 2009  5:49 PM: <p>Phil: what do you mean by "tennis match?"</p>

<p>Barry rarely looks straight ahead when he delivers a speech. He looks left for several seconds to read the left side of his teleprompter and then looks right to do the same thing. </p>

<p>This "back-and-forthing" looks like a tennis match.</p></p>
