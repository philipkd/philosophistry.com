<h1>Statistics on Statistics: Internet reporting wins again</h1>

<p>Statistics are horribly mishandled by the mainstream media. On the one hand you have networks cherry-picking polls that are the most sensational, for example the Zogby polls that show the presidential race neck-and-neck, while as an aggregation of polls shows Obama above by 9%. And then on the other hand, you have the cynics on the talk shows, who stop conversations by citing Mark Twain's, "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."</p>

<p>The media needs to treat statistics not cavalierly and not cynically, but with a measured interest. There is one site that gets the attitude just right. If you follow the way the guys at <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> think, you will see a shining example of a proper handling of statistics. I point to <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/whats-wrong-with-this-picture-aka-nate.html">this article</a> where they criticize a IBD/TIPP poll by pointing out that it gives John McCain a 74% to 22% advantage over Obama among the age group 18-24. Nate Silver, one of the writers for 538, points out that "Using a binomial distribution, the odds are 54,604,929,633-to-1 against. That is, about 55 billion to one. So, there is an 0.000000002% chance that IBD/TIPP just got really unlucky."</p>

<p>What 538 does is aggregate polls, but it's not out of a blind love of statistics, but out of a measured skepticism toward them. If, for example, a poll comes in that summarily cites a close race between McCain and Obama, and yet in the footnotes shows that McCain is beating Obama among blacks, then the poll is thrown out. That's just common sense.</p>

<p>I think what we're seeing, with the Internet, is the greater meaning that can be elicited from aggregation. For example, why should one media outlet give a film review by their one critic. What if that critic simply had indigestion when he or she saw the movie? A <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> score is much more meaningful than one silly review that the church lady at your local newspaper wrote.</p>

<p>It's becoming sad to me to see these CBS and ABC polls, because the 538 aggregate polling is miles ahead of these data points in terms of accuracy. If I were CBS or ABC, I'd outsource the polling or give it a different name, and instead report the more interesting, aggregate information.<br />
