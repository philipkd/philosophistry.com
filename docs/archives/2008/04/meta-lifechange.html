<h1>Meta Life-Change</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Thursday Apr 10, 2008 12:18 PM

<p>A couple months ago I stumbled upon the <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/14668/">most fascinating discussion thread on the Internet</a>. Jeremias from AskMetaFilter asked the community the following question:<blockquote>"Life-altering experiences. Can you point to a single experience in your life, as a child, which you can define as having contributed to the person you are today?"</blockquote><br />
The result is over 200 amazing stories. Many of these stories are of high literary value and deserve to be published in a book (which I'm currently working on). I decided to analyze and transform that entire thread into an infoviz (Information Visualization Project).</p>

<p><a href="/metalifechange/">Here is a link to the project: Meta-Life Change</a>. Just click on any of the underlined words, such as "lost confidence in authority" or "withdrew from others" and you will see the page re-arrange itself to show you how many stories were related to that story.</p>

<p>My goal with "Meta Life-Change" is to find patterns, make connections, and simply geek out on life-change. I condensed each story into a two-sentence cause-n'-effect summary that you can interact with.</p>

<p>What I've discovered is that, at least in that community, the most frequent cause for life-altering experiences was reading a book. And the most frequent result or consequence of a life-altering experience was finding a lifelong passion.</p>

<p>If anybody reading this wants to submit their own story to be included in a book or re-published on the Internet, please visit this <a href="/metalifechange/em4il-form.html">story submission form</a></p>

I came here by searching for 'ignorance is bliss' and found some of your entries really stimulative in the sense of thinking and reasoning.</p>

<p>Keep it up!<br />
Best regards!</p></p>
