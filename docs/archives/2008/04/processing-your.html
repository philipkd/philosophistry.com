<h1>Processing your field of vision while driving, as opposed to skimming</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Saturday Apr 19, 2008  2:58 PM

<p>I'm a paranoid driver, trying to figure out how to control safety. One trick that I've been working on lately is to maintain a constant level of focus on the objects in my field of vision. The problem that occurs is that I get so lost in thought, that my physical faculties related to vision are occupied imagining and visualizing thoughts that it doesn't process what is in front of me.</p>

<p>The trick I've been using is to bounce my eyes from "object" to "object" in my field of vision. I put "object" in quotes, but what I'm talking about is my eyes will, for example, focus on the left red tail light of a car in front of me. My eyes will move to it almost instantly, but there will be some time period, let's call it a recognition time, that it takes for me to process that thing as a red rectangular object of light. Once I've made the recognition, then I'll move my eyes to let's say, the letter O in "RIGHT TURN ONLY." I'll "see" the O immediately, but it may take 10-80ms to "recognize" that I'm looking at a ring that represents a letter. Other times I look at simple shapes, for example, if I'm in a valley, I'll recognize the U shape of the horizon.</p>
