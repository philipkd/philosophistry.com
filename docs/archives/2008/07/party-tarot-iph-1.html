<p><i>UPDATE: <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284038820&mt=8">If you have an iPhone or iPod Touch, click here to download Party Tarot</a>. Please be sure to download it, rate it, and review it!</i></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I mentioned that I started developing iPhone applications. Well, I have some stuff to show for my work!</p>

<p>I created a Tarot reader for the iPhone. Here is a video of the application:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FxTZLS5XV60&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FxTZLS5XV60&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>

<p>This started out as a personal Tarot reader, but then I brought it to a party and saw its true potential. People lined up to have me do their readings. And I invented things like having my listeners close their eyes and touch the iPhone to pick their cards. Here is a marketing image I put together that shows the kind of use-cases I'm imagining:</p>

<p><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284038820&mt=8">So if you have an iPhone or iPod Touch, click here to download Party Tarot</a>. It's starting out at $1.99.</p>

<p>It's going to be marketed under the name Nuclear Elements, my current solo freelance company. I got the card images from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider-Waite_tarot_deck">a 1909 public domain Rider-Waite-Smith Deck on Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Watup, congrats, I just put your blog in my rss feed.  Hope Austin is treating you well, I am actually eyeing the area myself, but not in the immediate future.</p>

<p>So you are doing iPhone apps now?  Looks cool, I started a project to do a card game on S60 but never really finished it (big surprise).</p>

<p>But anyway you should get in touch with my friend Ed McKenzie.  We used to write a bunch of DOS games together in high school and he is currently trying to do an iPhone apps startup (www.tinydiversions.com).  He is technically very brilliant (used to work for Google and Microsoft but bailed to do his own thing).</p>

<p>I think he is still on the waiting list for a device cert.  But maybe you guys could get together.  Send me an email for his contact info.</p>
