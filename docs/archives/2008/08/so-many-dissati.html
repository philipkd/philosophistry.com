<h1>So many dissatisfied creative types in this city</h1>

<p>Here in Austin, TX, it's more-or-less cliche that we live in a city of struggling artists. I took a defensive driving course earlier this week from a comedian that started out by saying, "I'm a comedian, script-writer, actor, etc., who just hasn't made it yet. Sounds like everybody else here, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>I have paradoxical views on success, especially creative types of success. On the one hand, I really want to "make it" and reach the highest peaks. On the other hand, I do believe that for everybody who reaches the peak, there's many many more who spend their whole lives on the slopes.</p>

<p>So if I were to be honest with myself, it's more likely that I'll live on the slopes than reach the peaks. So really, the wise thing is to make sure you're happy with yourself regardless of whether you're the rare individual who reaches the top or the more likely slope-dweller.</p>

<p>Yet at the same time, you often have to have faith that you'll be number one in order to get there. What you expect from yourself has such an impact on what you will try. And plus, you very well may end up being number one. After all, rank 1 is never empty. And so why can't it be you?<br />
