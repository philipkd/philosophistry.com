<h1>Principle: Laziness, in of itself, is not a sin</h1>

<p>This is something I've been thinking about lately, especially in regards to concepts such as Flow and autotelism. I've decided to be a little bit of a "lazy" programmer, which doesn't harm anybody but me since I own everything I make. But basically the way to be a "lazy" programmer, is to spend the most time on things that are fun/easy and ignore or downgrade the features I don't care about. The result is that I end up perfecting the features that I'm best at, and the other features become just satisfactory. If the work I do succeeds, it will be by virtue of the work that I cared about the most, and so I will naturally get more projects that cater to that competency.</p>

<p>Laziness can lead to problems, let's say, if you're too lazy to make an appointment. But, I don't think the onus is on the laziness. I think the onus is on you scheduling something you can't keep.</p>

<p>I don't think there's anything noble in having your life filled with permanent struggle and self-sacrifice. I do believe in some sacrifice for some causes, but to spend your whole life in an aggressive "making it" mode, is a form of self-annihilation to me.</p>

This would provide Ford with the info he needed to make his assembly lines more efficient.</p></p>
