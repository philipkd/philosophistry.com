<h1>Stock Market Experiment: Invest based on the products you use</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Tuesday Aug 19, 2008  4:11 PM 
</h2>

<p>My understanding of the stock market is that it's an information war. Whoever has the better information wins. So when it comes to personal investing, you have to look at how special your knowledge is. If you believe, for example as I do, in your abilities as a critical, yet mainstream, consumer, then why not pick stocks according to what you use on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>So today, I'm going to take a snapshot of the products I use, mention the stocks, and 6 months from now, re-visit to see how they performed. This is based on the theory of product holistic integrity: that if their products stink, so will the company.</p>

<p>AMZN - Amazon<br />
EBAY - eBay<br />
GOOG - Google<br />
MSFT - Windows XP (I still use it, it must have some value)<br />
AAPL - iPhone, MacBook Pro<br />
WPO - Washington Post Company, I use Slate.com daily<br />
NWS - News Corp, I read FOXNews everyday, I use Myspace everyday, I use rotten tomatoes (IGN)<br />
WFMI - Whole Foods, I eat there everyday<br />
COST - Costco, still shop there<br />
JBX - Jack-in-the-box, I still eat there<br />
TM - Toyota Motor Company, gotta love my Scion tC<br />
SWF - Still buy their generic brand goods<br />
DELL - My computer's still running strong<br />
URBN - Urban Outfitters, love their clothing<br />
CL - Colgate-Palmolive, love their toothpaste<br />
PG - Love my Gillette razors<br />
T - AT&T, I don't love the company, but they're with the iPhone, so they can't be that bad.<br />

<p>And you own a Scion</p></p>

Because the products start to suck before the stock price starts to dip. A company can still maintain their market share for a while by inertia, but the adept consumers, like myself, will have moved on by the time the rest of their customer base figures it out.</p></p>
<p>zack burt said on August 20, 2008  1:30 AM: <p>"remember personal info?" is broken btw</p>

<p>then I think you should be a bit more explicit. do you think all these stock prices will rise? what distinguishes the products that will fall? </p>

<p>ebay -- stock will go UP<br />
msft -- stock will go DOWN</p>

<p>because the "i still/i love/nothing" distinction is a little ambiguous yo.</p></p>
<p><a title="http://www.philosophistry.com/" href="http://www.philosophistry.com/" rel="nofollow">Philip Dhingra</a> said on August 20, 2008  1:34 AM: <p>Well, if we're just talking MSFT, my intuition says it'll go down. But, on the other hand, if we're raising this theory to a the level of being a rule, then I'd have to ask, "If I'm still using their products, they must still be a good and solid company" in which case, MSFT will go up.</p>

<p>According to this theory, all of these stocks are more likely to go up. The reality is, as a whole, this rule will produce a portfolio that will rise.</p></p>
<p>zack burt said on August 20, 2008  4:19 PM: <p>ok. so are you predicting that they will be higher, in proportion to indices of the stock exchanges they are on? i think that if you predicted some company downfalls as well (based on shoddy products), this post would be a lot more interesting in the next 6 months.</p></p>
