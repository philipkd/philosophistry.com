<h1>Sarah Palin ("SERR-UH PAY-LIN")</h1>

<p>I live in a world where there's many many more words that I know than I know how to pronounce. I don't watch TV, and I don't always talk to my friends about what I read. For most of yesterday, I was pronouncing Sarah Palin as "SERR-UH PAH-LIN." Didn't get corrected, nor didn't even know of the need to be corrected, until I saw YouTubes later in the day discussing her.</p>

<p>Medvedev. Tskhinvali. I even pronounced Ossetia in my head with a silent e for a while.</p>

<p>From wikipedia, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-chaining">Back-chaining</a>":<blockquote>Back-chaining is a useful technique in teaching oral language skills, specially with polysyllabic words. Suppose that you're teaching someone to pronounce the name 'Mussorgsky'. First, you ask him to say the last syllable: -sky; then to repeat it with -sorg- attached before: -sorg-sky; and all that remains is the first syllable: Mus-sorg-sky.</p>

<p>This technique is easier than the front-chaining, starting with the first syllable, which requires that the student put the new element first where it's more difficult to forget. Back-chaining keeps the phonological structure of English better than front-chaining (normally there is no difference in stress between a word spoken in isolation and one spoken at the end of a sentence) and it's arguably better to start with the final syllable (main stress in bold)</blockquote></p>

<p>The eminent psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi tells audiences his last name is easy to pronounce if you say "chicks sent me high."</p>

<p>Metathesis is the reversal of letters within a word, such as "iron" being pronounced as "iorn."</p>

<p><a href="http://kottke.org/08/04/saying-words-wrong-on-purpose">A wonderful thread on kottke about saying words wrong on purpose</a>. I'm a major offender. <a href="http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=12137&st=0&sk=t&sd=a">similar thread on xkcd</a>.</p>

<p>Sub-vocal articulation is the little voice in your head that pronounces while performing silent reading. I told my friend I wanted to take an intro course in every major language so I could sub-vocally articulate clearly and digest my reading more fluidly.</p>
