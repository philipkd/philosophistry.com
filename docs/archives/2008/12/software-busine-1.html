<h1>Software Business Idea: Help people monetize their wireless routers</h1>

<p>I know this has already been at least imagined a bunch of times, and maybe implemented crudely, but I wonder if I could open my wireless router, but then insert codes into all web traffic so that I get a percentage of ad revenue from people's Google Searches. Better yet, I wonder if I can get a percentage revenue from all iTunes, Amazon purchases, etc. There are maybe 1,000 to 10,000 services I could sign up for with affiliate codes, such that I could potentially make a decent chunk of change from people using my Wi-Fi. If I was getting a cut from a single or double-digit % of my neighbor's e-Commerce transactions, then that could make it worth it to open up my wireless router for free.</p>

<p>Obviously, there's some legal questions with that. Some affiliate providers may not like the idea, some don't care. But you, as a new company, could manage those relationships and provide a one-click solution for anybody with a wireless router to make some extra change from it.</p>

<p>This occurred to me when I thought about how Firefox made $66 million from skimming off Google Ad Revenue from searches on the default home page. And then I remembered logging into free wireless at the grocery store. I could imagine them, instead of a "please click here to begin surfing," it just shows a generic Google home page with embedded affiliate codes.</p>
