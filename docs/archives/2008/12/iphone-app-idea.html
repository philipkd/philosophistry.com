<h1>iPhone App Idea: Entertainment Book-style coupon app</h1>

<p>You know those <a href="http://www.entertainment.com/">Entertainment coupon books</a> you can buy for $15-$30 that provide you about a thousand or so sweet coupons? That should really be made into an iPhone app. My friend and I have been milking the coupon book he bought with their "buy one, get one free" deals, but often we forget to bring the book or the coupons. Or we don't know that a particular establishment even has coupons. You could make this app use your location, like Urban Spoon does, and provides you deals in your area. The app could, also, have a feature for the vendor to cross off, or delete the coupon once it's used. There are a couple of coupon apps on the iPhone, but they look lame.</p>

<p>This is yet another one of those things that make you think, "this would be perfect for the iPhone."</p>

<p>I am currently looking for a general coupon app and stumbled upon your post.</p></p>

Entertainment Book coupon information in an iPhone application which helps you locate deals via the GPS (for this version you still need your book, but the app will reveal stores / coupons near you).  Find stores / deals nearby and get directions too.  Give it a try!</p>

<p>Look for "coupons" in the App Store or just click here:</p>
