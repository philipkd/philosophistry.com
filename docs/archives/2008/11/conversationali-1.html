<h1>Conversationalists. Season 1, Episode 1.</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Wednesday Nov 12, 2008  1:55 PM

Here's this experimental radio show I put together. The title is "Conversationalists" and the premise is one-on-one conversations, no preparation, totally open-ended. I recorded my first show with my friend Guru on Sunday. We recorded a phone conversation of ours on Skype, and well, have a listen and see what you think.<p>The highlight is when we discuss the Indian-American Governor of Lousiana, Bobby Jindal, who is currently trading at $15 (out of $100) on intrade.com as becoming the Republican Nominee in 2012.

<p>I listened to your conversation and very much enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed the comparison between voting for Obama vs voting for Jindal for a person who identifies them as a community member - you both seemed to realize the analogy doesn't quite work, but the underlying issues it brings up are intriguing!</p>

<p>Your post-Obama depression reminds me so much of the depression universally acknowledged by all Harry Potter fans after reading the latest book!  Post-Potter depression they call it, and I can attest that it was awful (and worst after the last book!)  You wait soooo long and have soooo much invested in the characters, that it's just painful to know you either have to wait another two years, or worse, that there's no more coming.</p>

<p>I do, however, wonder what this says about your distinction between story and reality.  Or whether in these media-storytelling days it even matters.  If they can make you care about Obama as much as some people care about Harry Potter, that's a powerful thing! (Even if it's art imitating life)</p>

<p>I would love to be a guest on your show if you'll have me!</p></p>

<p>And on the 9/11 thing people seem to be trying to transfer it to other countries - rallying support?</p></p>
