<h1>Twitter Feature Idea: View your friend's Twitter home page</h1>

<p>This is for anybody who is working on creating a Twitter app and maybe wants an extra feature to set it apart. However, there's a good chance this feature already exists given that <a href="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/">Twitter has spawned an incredible number of mash-ups and apps</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is that I want to know what the Twitter home page looks like for my friends. I get the feeling that for a good handful of my friends, their home pages are 50% my posts, and then 50% their friends'. This is because I'm following 33 users, and a lot of my friends are maybe following 10-15. As a result, I usually post enough to match the volume of posts I see on my Twitter home page. This means maybe only 5-10% of the posts on my home page are from me. To me, it doesn't appear that I'm spamming anybody. But to my friends, I may be the most active user, and so I might be dominating their home pages.</p>

<p>I suspect this is happening because a third of the posts on my Twitter home page are from <a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">peterc</a>. To him, I'm sure he feels fine since he is following 310 users. For him, his posting volume doesn't look like spam either. (<3 peterc, btw.)</p>

<p>In any event, I want to verify how the experience is for other users when they see my posts.</p>

<p>There's got to be an app that already does this, so if you know of one, add it to the comments. Either way, I think Twitter should make a plug-in architecture or app system like facebook (only private-facing, though), so that you can enable experimental features, just like you can choose from ~20 extra features in Gmail Labs (which are great, btw. As a side note, this is a much better alternative to feature bloat).</p>
