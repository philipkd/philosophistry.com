<h1>Regretflix</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2199365/">John Swansburg from Slate points out</a> an interesting phenomena that I've experienced a little bit and that I also suspected was pervasive given how many Netflix wrappers I see in the same spot at friends' houses.</p>

<p>Basically, that there are certain movies that people get from Netflix but then just let sit in their house, never being watched. Sometimes they sit for days, sometimes for years.</p>

<p>Swansburg honed in on this interesting concept:<blockquote><i>Hotel Rwanda</i> is that rare movie about a devastating subject that nevertheless feels like something you really do need to see. The same goes for <i>Schindler's List</i>, which finished a close second among Slate readers. Both appeal to the lofty sense of ourselves that comes to the fore when we're managing our queues. Neither feels especially appealing after a long day at the office.</blockquote><br />
The way it's occurred for me is that I download movies, thinking I want to watch them, but never getting around to it. I've had movies I downloaded years ago that are sitting on my hard drive, taking up space. A good example is <i>City of God</i>. Apparently I downloaded this in 2006. But then it looks like I re-downloaded it a year later, thinking I should watch it. I also went through my downloads and tried to clear all the junk, and apparently I didn't delete this movie.</p>
