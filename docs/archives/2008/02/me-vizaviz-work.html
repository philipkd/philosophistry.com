<h1>Me viz-a-viz work</h1>

<p>A few weeks ago I left my salaried job as a video game designer. I had been at Aspyr for a year and a half. My name is now attached to these games:<ul><li><a href="http://sims.yahoo.com/about/castawaystories">The Sims: Castaway Stories</a><li><a href="http://sims.yahoo.com/about/petstories">The Sims: Pet Stories</a><li><a href="http://sims.yahoo.com/about/lifestories">The Sims: Life Stories</a> (PC Mag: Editor's Choice)<li><a href="http://www.diegilde2.com/">The Guild 2</a></ul></p>

<p>It was a fairly awesome job, and the fact that I was there for a year and a half is a testament to how much it approximated what I want out of my work-life. I liked being around a variety of personalities, from creative types to production people. I liked working on interesting material and with an interesting toolset (The Sims is one of the best-selling games of all time). But in the end, I just became more and more confident that I would only be happy if I was independent.</p>

<p>I left with the intention of being a freelance game designer. And then my plan shifted to making re-sellable software for video games. But honestly as it stands now, I'm not 100% sure of my direction. I'm very certain, though, about a lot of what I want in my future career. The following books helped me figure that out, big time: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPathfinder-Choose-Lifetime-Satisfaction-Success%2Fdp%2F0684823993&tag=philosophistr-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Pathfinder: How to Choose or Change Your Career for a Lifetime of Satisfaction and Success</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=philosophistr-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWhat-Color-Your-Parachute-2008%2Fdp%2F1580088678%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1203720258%26sr%3D1-1&tag=philosophistr-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">What Color Is Your Parachute? 2008: A Practical Manual for Job-hunters and Career-Changers</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=philosophistr-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> for guiding me in self-discovery. But there's still a lot of unknowns and of course you have to see how your vision of what you want in life refracts when it hits the pavement.</p>
