<h1>A BBQ and Spaceflight</h1>

<p><I>(Progress on my attempts at lucid dreaming (LD).  You're reading in reverse order.  WILD == Wake-Induced Lucid Dreaming.  Also, attempting to find creative and more appropriate ways to relate dreams--i.e. stories and narratives aren't exactly fitting, esp. given the large deficit of clarity)</I></p>

<p><I>Around 8AM, I had woken up, wrote down the above dream, and then I went back to bed.  This time, in addition to affirmations, I flooded my mind with random visual imagery.  This was hard beecause I was tired, but it did start to carry itself forward.  I was laying flat on my back with some blanket, and I was trying to have a WILD.  I lost a little bit of awareness of my space, but I think I fell into the abyss of sleep before I ever met an aware state of transition.</I></p>

<p>The sun is beating down like a wild horse.  I park in a park, and encounter my best friend.  He is in the side of the parking lot opposite of me, while as a BBQ is going on to the left of me on my side.  Apparently te BBQ is for a political rally, and the main guy is listing off various things in a manner:</p>

<p>"We used $ money for this building" and that building and so fort.  Chaz and I are laughing at this guy, "what is this guy" kinda... simply because we feel that way toward politicians in general.</p>

<p>Then there is some talk about space programs and I walk over to the grassy area behind Chaz, and then I get into a spacesip.</p>

<p>For a second, I thought I was Luke Skywalker, or I was in that Star Tours ride in Disneyland.  There was some physics concept that upon take-off they have to keep pushing some jets on one side to keep it away from hitting rocks or something, and so you'd be making a parabolic shot out of the atmosphere.  I did this, and it was kind of cool, don't remember too much.  Eventually I landed.  Then I think I was either floating or hung out in the trees, where I saw one of the most beautiful things ever:</p>

<p>Imagine a hummingbird-butterfly combination with wings and a body that form the shape of a Spade in a deck of cards.  The colors were the shimmering emerald green border and crystaline azure that you find in the eyes of peacocks' feathers.  A swarm of about 35 of these characters snaked together like a magic carpet.  The sight of these cascading around the trees from which I was perched filled me with butterflies of the stomach, and pleasure.</p>

<p>Somehow, these wondorous, docile creatures became associated with the dull and irritating windows icon.  This is the icon of the flag-like red-green-blue-yellow window that may start cascacading across your screen in various screen savers.</p>
