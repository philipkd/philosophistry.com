<h1>10 years from now it won't matter?</h1>

<p>In middle shool, I used to tell kids, "dude, stop crying, or forget about this or that, in 10 years, it won't matter at all."  Rue that comment!  Looking back now, 10 years later, I still remember everything I did or say that was important.  Sure I made some silly small infractions that were unimportant, but there were so many other things that I thought weren't a big deal at the time but have set tremendous precedents that changed my character.</p>

<p>I remember one time, in elementary school, I wasn't getting much attention from the "popular kids" so I adapted my behavior to sort of suck up to the crowd and "look cool."  and then, after that, that became my M.O. until now, I look back and feel terrible that that's a part of my behavior.</p>

<p>So, remember kids, or remember now anyways, everything you do does have importance.  The instant is always an opportunity to set new precedents that will live with you forever.</p>
