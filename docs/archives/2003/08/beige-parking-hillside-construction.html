<h1>Beige Parking, Hillside Construction</h1>

<p><I>(Progress on my attempts at lucid dreaming (LD).  You're reading in reverse order.  WILD == Wake-Induced Lucid Dreaming.  Also, attempting to find creative and more appropriate ways to relate dreams--i.e. stories and narratives aren't exactly fitting, esp. given the large deficit of clarity)</I></p>

<p><I>I started trying to sleep at 3AM.  To induce a LD, I repeated affirmations such as, "I will wake up in my dreeam."</I></p>

<p>I'm driving toward five half-way constructed housing projects.  The houses are cookie-cutter 2-storied buildings staggered upon a hill like the hills on the side of I-15 in Mira Mesa.  From afar, I can see the lattice-like wood beams already ready, waiting for the roofs to be installed.  My mom and two construction workers are at the foot of a building site.  They're actually underneath the shade of possibly an empty parking garage or other construction project.  They're making fun of me, and I'm unsure why.  I had come back with a long piece of wood for the building, and I take it withm y right hand, and toss it onto the dirt ground so  as to give it to them.</p>

<p>They continue laughing.  I look at the wood and the white paint has chipped off from it.  I ask them why, and they make some hand-waving explanation about teen-agers and their hands being a certain way that makes it easy for paint to chip off.</p>

<p>I take the car that I was in away from the construction zone.  The place was overcast.  I end up toward a parking structure on a steep curve, similar to a part of Grand Teft Auto III with a hill, and some streets on the side.  I take a left turn and give the car to a valet..</p>

<p>Somewere I brought cookies to my mom.</p>
