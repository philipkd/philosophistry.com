<h1>Deanisms</h1>

<p>I asked Howard Dean about blogging and the White house, this is what he haid to say:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001364.shtml">Finally, one of you asked if there would be a White House blog. Why not? Thanks again, Howard Dean"</A>.</p>

<p>Dean's a cool guy--I knew him when I was building websites.  After he checked out Philosophistry, he asked me if I could help setup his own blog.  So I pointed him over to my friend <A HREF=http://www.lessig.org/blog/>Lawrence Lessig</A> at Stanford, and they ended up working out an arrangement where Dean would cover Lessig's blog while Lessig was hanging out in San Diego with my parents (I had homework so I stayed in Palo Alto--also to make sure Dean wasn't misusing his blog).</p>

<p>Alter <A HREF=http://www.msnbc.com/news/947647.asp?0cv=CB20>clued me</A> into this piece he wrote at Newsweek regarding Dean.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm an Edwards fan, but that's only because <A HREF=http://slate.msn.com/>Microsoft</A> decided to buy a controlling stake in the articles that I post on Philosophistry.  On Microsoft's blog, they normally pump Edwards regarding his passion.  I've read some of the stuff he said, and it's pretty cool as well.</p>

<p>However, this Dean guy's been making big headway and it's been hard for me to give Edwards equal spotlight.  Anyways, unfortunately, I'm afraid Dean is going to end up a McLoser like McCain and McGovern... i.e. be a darling to the brain-crust but miss out on the <A HREF=http://www.philosophistry.com/2003_08_02_archive_index.html#105987717759115822>NASCAR dads</A> and Soccer moms.</p>

<p>Oh well, we'll throw a party for Dean in San Diego when it's all over.  Take care.</p>
