<p>"It is the biggest political story in the country? That's interesting. That says a lot. That speaks volumes. Oh, I think there's maybe other political stories. Isn't there, like a presidential race coming up?" - President George W. Bush.</p>

<p>"I will never arm-wrestle Arnold Schwarzenneger." - President George W. Bush.</p>

<p>"I have known Arnold for years and know he'll be a great governor. It is critical to the rest of the nation that California's economic crisis be solved, and I think Arnold will get that job done." - Warren Buffett</p>

<p>"He's like the golem. All these Jewish Democratic studio people created this Terminator which has conquered the world for them, just like the golem, created by Jews in Prague in the Middle Ages. The golem was bigger and stronger than normal mortals. And once they woke him up, he controlled those who created him. He has a life of his own, he's uncontrollable, and he's the Republican candidate. Now all these left-wing liberals are biting their lips and saying: What did we create?" <br />
- Ludi Boeken, movie producer.</p>

<p>I had no idea that <A HREF=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/golem.html>Golem was a Jewish legend.</A></p>
