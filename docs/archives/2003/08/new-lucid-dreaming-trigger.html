<h1>New Lucid Dreaming Trigger</h1>

<p><I>I'm experimenting with <A HREF=http://www.lucidity.com/>Lucid Dreaming</A>.  Lucid dreams are dreams in which you become aware that you're dreaming.  In that state you can control your environment and retain a memory of the dream that carries on into the waking life.  A prerequisite of becoming an <A HREF=http://www.theoneironaut.blogspot.com/>oneironaut</A> (as lucid dream travelers are wont to call themselves) is establishing consistent dream recall.  Being able to remember your dreams assists you in becoming aware that you're dreaming.</p>

<p>I'm also experimenting with different ways of dream story-telling and elaborating on curious dream happenings.</p>

<p>Below is a strange happening in today's first morning nap</I>.</p>

<p>I'm holding in my hand a piece of paper with numbers from 9 through 12.  These represent the various hours in which I have class.  There is one entry per line, such as 9 - Biology, 10 - Physics, etc.  However, there are two number 11's and next to the second 11 is a 12 scribbled out.  This makes sense, though, since we have rotating schedules each day.  So this indicates my 11 o'clock switches between the two classes.</p>

<p>The curious part is the scribbled-out 12.  Somehow my dream knew that I would be hastily jotting down my schedule and would put the wrong number for my rotating class.  However, I never went through this process in my dream.  I just opened up the paper and there it was, my mistake reflected.</p>

<p>I felt weird because I was seeing evidence of something I did, yet had no recollection of having done so.  It was simultaneously familiar and surprising.  My thoughts were both, "Oh, how funny, I do that all the time" and "But how odd, I don't remember writing down this schedule."  The "I" in "I do this all the time" was like I was referring to myself in the 3rd person, such as "Phil does this all the time."  It was almost like I had inserted myself into the timeline of a Doppelganger Phil from a parallel universe.</p>

<p>This strange discordance, should it occur again, can maybe remind me that I'm dreaming.  This can now serve as a trigger to assist my entrance into lucidity.</p>
