<p><a title="Evolution/Involution of Consciousness" href="http://onebehindthemany.tripod.com/">Evolution/Involution of Consciousness</a></p>

<p><I>The Purporsive Evolution and Involution of Consciousness in the Universe</I></p>

<p>500+ Links attempting to unravel the secrets of consciousness.</p>

<p>So I was reading <A HREF=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316180661/qid=1061677832/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-3269972-0411955?v=glance&s=books&n=507846>Consciousness Explained</A> by Daniel Clement Dennet (a.k.a. Daniel Dennet).  I started out with the following mindset:</p>

<p><I>Consciousness is such a mystery, what is it?  Where is all the stuff that I see.  Is there a mind's eye?  And is there a mind's mind's mind's eye?</I></p>

<p>I trucked through the first 100 pages, and Dennet pinned down many of the concerns regarding consciousness, among them the following:</p>

<p>- Mind-Body problem (Descartes felt there was this other space where computation happened and would then port into our brains somewhere)<br />
- The actual locaton of what we see<br />
- The composition of mind-stuff</p>

<p>However, toward the end of my 100-page journey, Dennet actually started to unravel the mysteries.  He demonstrated certain things about my consciouness that I thought were one way when in fact they were actually illusions of a process going completely another way.</p>

<p><B>He provides mental exercises that do affect your way of seeing the world.  For a few minutes after some of them, I had trouble seeing things like a normal person, i.e. I had trouble walking or reading signs--I was too aware of the process and started to doubt things in the ways described by Dennet</B></p>

<p>Needless to say, I felt that the conclusion I was getting was that <I>All sacred concepts such as I, or an inner self, was just illusions building on illusions of subjectivity, cohesivness of perception, and a separation of inner perception from outer perception</I></p>

<p><B>It was also a fun text with modelling that was creative such as composing an argument over whether your mind functioned in a <I>Stalinesque</I> or <I>Orwellian</I> fashion... i.e. whether it would, as Stalin would, alter reality by staging events, or as the members of Minitrue in 1984 would do by constantly changing the archives retroactively</B></p>

<p>Needless to say, <I>my curiosity was satiated and I stopped reading.  I knew that if I kept on reading further I would eventually have a complete understanding of consciousness.  <B>All I wanted to get was the certaintity that consciousness was explainable and that I could access it through hand-waving if necessary</B> but actually fully understanding consciousness ceased to amaze me.</p>
