<h1>****Marry Rich****</h1>

<p>I think I'm going to marry rich...</p>

<p>... 1 ... I hate working<br />
... 2 ... financial disparity between partners or any disparity in capabilities probably aids in marriage security<br />
... 3 ... I'm a good teacher (teach kids) and have spent a lot of time already thinking about the topic of child rearing<br />
... 4 ... By the time I reach marrying age, women in America would be much closer to men than they are now in financial earning power.  More of them enter college and the workforce than Men anyways.<br />
... 5 ... I want to spend my time pursuing my passions, not financial ambitions.<br />
... 6 ... It fits with the pattern of somewhat eccentric decisions that I'm prone too.<br />
... 7 ... Why does it have to be breadwinning dad anyways?  Mainly tradition.<br />

They tend to marry women in their own socio-economic class. Sorry to burst your bubble. Take your time, and try to find a generous, good-hearted man who loves you; you'll be much happier.</p></p>

<p>Now that's not so hard, is it? Heh heh...</p></p>
