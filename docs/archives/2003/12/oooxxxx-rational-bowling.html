<h1>(O...O....OXXXX) Rational Bowling</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Wednesday Dec 31, 2003  2:53 AM

<p>(I've been trying to educate myself to be a more rational thinker, here's a sample of some progress)</p>

<p>We went bowling this past night and I got a chance to see rational thinking in action.</p>

<p>Here is a simple "before" and "after" of my thought space to show what effect may have been gleaned from imprinting rational thinking into my mind.<br />

<br/>
<p>oooo|||||BEFORE</p>

<p>(This is a more emotionally locked in phil)</p>

<p>- I'd spend a lot of time getting into gear or mode before swinging.  In between shots, I'd be trying to get myself "relaxed" or into a "confident mode" hoping that that would affect my swing.<br />
- I'd spend a lot of time analysing the score, looking at where the game was going.  I'd also be looking at competing bowlers in other lanes, thinking about how well I was doing in comparison to them.<br />
- I'd score a strike and think that I'd be doomed to mess up on the next one.</p>

<p>oooo|||||AFTER</p>

<p>(This is a Phil that is willing to look the Truth in the face and accept it)</p>

<p>- I understood that the primary determinant of my success in bowling was the attention and effort I put while I had the ball in my hand and was on deck.  I then stopped focusing on how I was going to bowl and put my attention to the bowling process itself<br />
- I convinced myself that the outcome of this game, in the larger scheme of things, was a trifling.  Believe it or not, this was hard for me to swallow.<br />
- I tried to convince myself that I CAN score a strike.  Just knowing that you are ABLE to do something in a lot of cases can help you actually do it.  This made me more confident</p>

<p>In addition, I had a more case-by-case self-correcting of my game.  I'd tell myself, okay, you need to focus more on your aim now or maybe I should use more energy.  i.e. I'd distribute my thoughts toward things that actually helped my game.</p>

<p>My scores improved.  In addition, I recognized I was tired in the 4th game, and just took it easy.  I switched balls and threw in weird ways to get me from being competitive--an attitude which was making me a little stressed.  And when I went home, I didn't think much about how I did relative to others.</p>

<p>Describing this event may seem petty.  But, oh well.  It's progress in my book.</p>

<p>(I'm doing all this "Progress Tracking" BTW because I read somewhere that keep a journal of your progress helps you stay on tasks.  It also reminds you of minor successes which are helpful in obtaining happiness)</p></MTIfNotEmpty>
