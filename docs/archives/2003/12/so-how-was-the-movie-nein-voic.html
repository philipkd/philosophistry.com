<h1>So, how was the movie || NEIN VOICE PHIL@!</h1>

<p>SNAPSHOT OF PHIL TRYING TO FIND HIS UNIQUE VOICE:  HERE IS A DRAFT POST I WAS GOING TO MAKE</p>

<p>Others: So, how was the movie?<br />
Me: Umm…. <br />
Others: huh?  I thought it was good, how ‘bout you?<br />
Me: Umm….  I’m not good with movie opinions</p>

<p>I’ve been having trouble telling people whether I like movies or not.  I don’t know what it is.  There’s nothing to it, right?  The movie was… good? (or bad).  See, that was easy.  Not so fast buddy, was it really good?  Eh.  Was it really bad?  Eh.  It’s like saying a movie was good or bad is like a big blanket statement that just kind of ruins the finer ups and downs on the film.</p>

<p>And it is liiiving?  Movies are an extension of living.</p>

<p>This is not my voice.</p>

<p>SEE, I HAD THIS GREAT IDEA WHERE SOMEHOW I COULD TIE MY INABILITY TO SAY MOVIES WERE GOOD OR BAD TO MY INABILITY TO ANSWER WHETHER MY WEEK WAS GOOD OR BAD, IT’S LIKE ASKING WHETHER YOU THINK LIVING IS GOOD OR BAD, AND IT’S LIKE, UHM, SURE.  I DON’T KNOW WHY I WATCH MOVIES.  I HAVE TO WATCH THEM, BUT NOT IN AN ADDICTION KIND OF WAY.  IT’S MORE LIKE LIVING AND WATCHING MOVIES ARE SYNCHRONOUS.—THIS WAS THE IDEA I WAS TRYING TO GET AT, BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY STORY, NOR IS IT PROBABLY A GOOD POINT.  SO I TURNED IT INTO THIS ALL-CAPS THING… THIS META-META-META-META-METAAAAAAAH</p>

<p>The film is <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/MysticRiver-1126042/reviews.php">Mystic River</a> The film was.... deh.  Okay, it had a major emotional impact on me, it was heavy.  Some parts manifested kitschy and appeared unripened.  I was moved and I feel the film will stick with me for little while<br />
