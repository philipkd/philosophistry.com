<h1>Blog High</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Tuesday Dec 16, 2003  4:07 PM

<p>The blogosphere feels like High School all over again.</p>

<p>Just like in High School, there is the popular crowd.  You know who they are in the blogosphere.  <a href="http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/">Ernie</a>, <a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/">Rebecca</a>, <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net/">Will</a>, <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Pirillo</a>, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Winer</a>, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron</a>.  And then there's <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Cory Doctorow</a>.  The alpha-male cum yearbook editor-in-chief, giving a great <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/01/01/cory.html">meta-commentary</a> on the usefulness of blogging, and co-authoring a <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/essblogging/index.html">book on blogging</a>.<br />

<br/>
<p>They have their own circles, referencing and gossiping about one another.  Just look at them, jovially cross-linking each other, knowing how quickly their guestbooks, inboxes, and pageranks increase.</p>

<p>And like in High School, when the big cliques purchased ad space in the back of the yearbooks to self-congratulate on being a member of their clique, the blogosphere has its own <a href="http://acepilots.com/mt/mt-static/technos.html">similar ceremonies</a>.</p>

<p>The in-crowd of the blogosphere has the same perks of the popular crowd in High School.  They have their own <a href="http://www.fairvue.com/?feature=awards2003">prom court</a>.  They have the lion's share of the blogging hits online and the lion's share of the blogging pageranks.  If they want to run a "<a href="http://uber.nu/2001/04/06/">google bomb</a>"--the blogging equivalent of the senior-prank--they definitely have the power to do so. </p>

<p>You can tell I'm jealous.  Just like I was jealous of the popular kids in High School, I too would love to revel in all the attention that comes with being in <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/top100.html">Technorati's Top 100</a>.</p>

<p>But I don't speak their language, I don't wear their clothes.  I couldn't don the act of a populist technophile who loves to curl up to my laptop and blog, while I pet my cat.  I couldn't recycle articles about technology and funny nuances a la <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a> or Aaron Schwartz.  Nor could I toot my horn like some sort of freedom-writer/Thomas Paine type like <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/">Glen</a>, <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/">Atrios</a>, and <a href="http://volokh.com/">Volokh</a></p>

<p>And maybe that's why I never became part of the popluar crowd in High School.  I'd sure want the perks and trappings of having many hits and high page ranks, but I wouldn't want to actively participate, go to all their <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/">school dances</a>, and become them.</p>

<p>And my perspective is all wrong.  It's not like your position in the pecking order is really a choice anyways.  I don't think <a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/">Raed</a> said one day, "I'm going to be a passionate and emotional voice for injustice in Iraq in order to become a phenom."</p>

<p>I feel like a sophomore in Blog High.  I've been blogging for about <a href="/archives/2003/03/000001.html">8 months</a> now, but have a moderate following and a few loose blog-fiends.  I've got some page-rank power, half of my page views come from search engines now.</p>

<p>Even if I wrote a few impactful articles that got high on <a href="http://www.blogdex.com/">blogdex</a>, I still wouldn't get the keys to the in-crowd.  I'd have to fill up their comment forms, e-mail them about broken links, trackback their posts with "me too"isms, and tone down my arrogance.</p>

<p>The lesson I learnt from High School is that you can't fake it.  Selling out gets easily detected and rejected.  Likewise, I think I'd stick out like a sore-thumb among the elite bloggers.  So, I think I'll follow the common imperative, "be yourself."  That's what blogging's all about anyways, letting yourself unfurl in ways that the real world can't permit.</p></MTIfNotEmpty><h2>Comments</h2><p><a title="http://acepilots.com/mt/" href="http://acepilots.com/mt/" rel="nofollow">The Commissar</a> said on December 16, 2003  5:05 PM: <p>Great post. </p>
