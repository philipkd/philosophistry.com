<p>"Lakers agree to deal with Payton"<br />
as either<br />
a) Lakers agree to [a] deal with Payton.<br />
or<br />
b) Lakers agree to [put up] with Payton.</p>

<p>PS, it appears that Kobe has bitchslapped some girl so as to increase his "street cred."  this is esp. warranted given that he got 1/2 the amount of endorsement that Lebron got ($90M).  and Kobe's already got multiple titles, even consecutive ones to his name...</p>

<p>guess it hurts him that he speaks Italian fluently and never committed a crime (I think).  That and the fact that he's a PANSY at times... whininng about LA perks that he should be getting, or conveniently disappearing when Shaq gets the MVP instead of him.</p>

<p>My thought is that Jordan'd man up and support his teammate in those situations, and wouldn't wine about crap.  + I still haven't really fallen in love with Kobe's hair styles, ever.</p>

<p>now Jordan's?  or rather his lack of, that's smooth.  Jordan w/ the goatee, even better.  Jordan w/ hair, knid of looks raw, on the edge.  Kobe, looks like a clown.</p>

<p>NOW, keep in mind that I don't watch Basketball, ever.  Except this one time I remember in one of the NBA finals, Jordan was walking past the 3 point line, away from a basket in disgust, and just tossed the ball behind him and it went it... and the crowd went nuts... yeah... that was back in like...mmmn... middle school?</p>

<p>damn, too much posting after a really long post is not good because there was a good one down below that I wanted ppl to see.</p>
