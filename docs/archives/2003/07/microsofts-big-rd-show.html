<h1>Microsoft's ''big'' R&D show...</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Thursday Jul 31, 2003  2:53 PM

<p>Bill Gates, in defense of their monopolistic practices once said, "all we want to do is innovate."... and now, billions of dollars later in R&D budgets, this is <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2001311067&zsection_id=268448455&slug=msscience30&date=20030730">best</a> Microsoft can come up with... basically toy robots with webcams and some semi-interesting pattern recognizers for sign-language.</p>

<p><I>People waiting to take an elevator could enter their destination floor into a cellphone instead of pushing the elevator button</I> -- Hmm, doesn't make a great elevator pitch</p>

<p><I>Copy machines could be programmed to sort and staple from a Pocket PC. </I> -- Some R&D got a promotion for finding the 1001th thing you can do with your Microsoft Pocket PC.</p>

<p><I>Johannes Helander is working on a glove that could translate sign language into digitized letters.</I> -- Sounds really efficient.</p>

<p><I>Darko Kirovski is developing a low-cost way for motor-vehicle departments and companies to create identification cards on paper</I> -- What?  Oh my ID is not made out of just paper & some laminate?</p>

<p>I've been turned off by fairs and "labs"... even <A HREF=http://labs.google.com/>Google Labs</A> is not that interesting.</p>

<p>I liked Steve Jobs' approach to R&D which was to R&D for actual product creation.  This brought forth the iPod, the Titanium notebook, and the first iMac--stuff that people actually bought and use.  I also like the R&D of hungry college students and Open-source-like nerd warriors that brought forth: ICQ, Winamp, Napster, Gnutella (which later metastasized into KaZaA), the 1st Google (nerd-minded & PhD dudes), Webcrawler (some hacker made that and sold it to AOL for $1M in 1993ish--the 1st dot-com millionaire), Andreesen with Mosaic... etc.</p>
