<h1>That's Rich</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Tuesday Sep  2, 2003  6:18 PM

<p>What's the one most common activity that rich people do most frequently?</p>

<p>Anyone want to venture a guess?</p>

<p>Guess what?  The answer is: they all try to make more money.</p>

<p>That's right... it's not any of the following:<br />
- Attempt to expand their minds<br />
- Pursue their hidden talents (singing, arts, thinking)<br />
- Effect social change</p>

<p>What? you say.  You mean to say they're just like those monkeys that push the button once and then keep on pushing it?</p>

<p>You mean money's just like crack in that once you get some, you spend the rest of your life trying to support the habit?</p>

<p>You mean to say that it's not just those who are down on their luck who say that money's the root of all evil?</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Okay, you get the point.</p>

<p>Continuing with the "personal experience" theme, my experiences with money can be neatly divided into two categories: good and bad.</p>

<p>In the good cases, money was empowering, liberating, thrilling etc.  This usually occured when I made a transition from dependence to independence.  Money then freed up my time, and allowed me to purchase tools that would aid the pursuit of my passions.</p>

<p>In the bad cases, I was a slave to cash.  This occurred when I had more money than I needed to sustain my main interests and get by.  The extra cash would then spill-over into luxuries.  I'd then get used to those luxuries until they soon became my "needs" and I had to keep working hard to support them.  Plus, the more expensive the goods, the more costliy the maintenence.  As time would go on, I'd become more attached to the money and the goods, and the more wit and business-savvy it would require to keep that lifestyle up.  Instead of enriching my life, money took out of it.</p>

<p>To those that understand this lesson already, this is common sense.  But unfortunately, you'll find, common sense is not so common.</p>
