<p>What narratives haven't been explored?</p>

<p>In our search to kill boredom and quench our search for novelty, we have killed novelty</p>

<p>One day, we will narrow the whole thing down to a few basic metaphors, a few universal truths on a tablet<br />

<br/>
<p>I can't say we should willfully slow down</p>

<p>but I don't wholly reject the unabomber and the neo-luddites</p>

<p>Matrix:Revolutions, before it was edited for hollywood I'm sure had some sort of import on this issue</p>

<p>Maybe we can find some sort of beauty and solace in recursive revolutions</p>

<p>DNA created our brain</p>

<p>Google is a bigger brain</p>

<p>Blogs are just brains. And what are brains but filters from the many to the one with a semi-optimal method and algorithsm</p>

<p>memory expansion, rehashing, and distributing.</p>

<p>layers upon layers that continue to link back up to themself</p>

<p>so relating that back to the self</p>

<p>I've been on this self-improvement crusade, to be able to change myself, to become the specific ... dah</p>

<p>but you have to change, you have to grow, you can't willfully say, I don't want progress</p>

<p>in a way, we're designed to kill ourselves. Every step forward is another step back</p>

<p>we're killing the planet</p>

<p>but only as a way of feeding a newer planet</p>

<p>that of human society and virtualization.</p>

<p>so there is a revolutions of suicide ontop of suicide</p>

<p>but, they did throw in love in Matrix:Revolutions</p>

<p>and love is important, because it grips you irrationally, and is a pure hot emotion.</p>

<p>sure, it's a mixed bag, and it's not love itself that matters</p>

<p>but pure passion..</p>

<p>as much as we abstract ourselves away from our natural selves into the artifical simulacra</p>

<p>we shouldn't forget the orginal heart where all of that was motivated in the first place</p>

<p>but even by saying this in the first place, it's already doing this.</p>

<p>is there such thing as a willful irrationality?</p>

<p>eh, actually I'm sure there is</p>

<p>I don't have to think, to analyze, to progress.</p>

<p>I can stand back, throw myself into eddies with a total lack of reck.</p>

<p>nihilism? whoops, did somebody say that taboo word?</p>

<p>or maybe, whining about this stuff on a blog is the key to softening the blow... cuz after this, it's off to do my homework, eat, chat, and sleep</p></MTIfNotEmpty>
