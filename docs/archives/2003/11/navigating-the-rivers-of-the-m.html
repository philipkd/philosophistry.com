<p><i>Here is another stream of consciousness in trying to unify my metacognitive processes.  Maybe there is a science about all this stuff that I'm missing.  I'm hoping to take an intro psych course here, so I know where to look, but my intuition is that modern psysch is just barely coming out of its traditionally simple study of mental illness, and not more esoteric and abstract insights into the relationship between mind and destiny.</i></p>

<p>The Mind organism, it actually moves forward and has very similar analogs to the real world.</p>

<p>but basically, it has location, multiple destinations, awareness, direction, and then action.<br />

<br/>
<p>I am here, i have these options, I am self-aware or aware of my destinations, I am leaning this way, and then active movement, and passive sweeping up.</p>

<p>Everything is like that.  Thing is, even thinking about this thing is part of those "options" I only have the "option" now to think about...</p>

<p>yeah it's weird, but that's the meta system, there are things you can do pre-instant, like re-choosing, and I have my patterns that I pick in the mind... like control modes, natural modes, etc.. you know, usually I get trapped into one or two options, and I can't get out, but there's always a way, always a set of choices, I didn't have to take a do X this morning, -i could've ended it early, there would be various resistances and I choose among those.</p>

<p>sometimes though, then I am trapped mentally I forget, or I get overzealous, and then I'm just pushing myself against the wall over and over again, and that sux, that creates more pain, and that sux, that's when I dupe myself.</p>

<p>By a successive series of choices though, one can present various options to the mind at different times, and eventualy one can make it so that the options in front of them are always of acertain kind, and by changing the location significantly, is our character then changed?</p></MTIfNotEmpty><h2>Comments</h2><p><a title="http://www.stanford.edu/~csar/blog/" href="http://www.stanford.edu/~csar/blog/" rel="nofollow">Can Sar</a> said on November 15, 2003  7:45 PM: <p>I definitely agree with you, Psychology should be the study of thought processes, and not just concentrate on diseases.</p></p>
