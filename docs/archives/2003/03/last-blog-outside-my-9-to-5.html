<p>Last blog outside my 9-to-5, or now, 10.5-to-5.  But here's a preview of what's to come:<br />
- Russian doll answer to a mundane "why"<br />
- The wisdom of being nice<br />
- Biases toward handicaps<br />
- How the word "why" developed<br />
- If it takes two to tango, why not salsa?</p>
<h2>Comments</h2><p>Ares said on December  9, 2003  2:32 PM: <p>Wow . . . that is all I can say about that entry explaining no god and Truth.  I had always looked at believing in god as a joke... that it didn't make sense.  I just have to tell anyone on this site listening, that answered my spiritual question.  And the more and more I read on it made more sense.  I was looking for answers when there were right there in front of me the whole time.  I had to look within myself to find the answers.  Kudo's, gracious, whatever language it is out there that you speak.  Thank you.  You have really helped me out in finding out who I am and having reason to actually follow my heart.  Thanks guys.</p></p>
