<p><I>What if the Prophecy is true?</p>

<p>What if tomorrow this war could be over? Isn’t that worth fighting for? Isn’t that worth dying for?</I></p>

<p>So you've seen the trailer for the Matrix, but do you really know what's going on?  Who is the hot half-asian chick at the end?  Who are these twins?  They're not really agents.  And what are these "upgrades"?  The answers to these might be spoilers, so don't read on if you want a "pure" experience.  I decided to read half of the <A HREF=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/TheMatrixReloaded-1122457/about.php>production notes</A> anyway for the hell of it.  So to answer some of these questions.  The hot half-asian chick near the end is the wife of Seraph, a snitch within Zion.  The twins are Seraph's bodyguards.  The guy in the motorcycle with Trinity is the "key" hacker.  The "upgrades" Neo speaks of is the ego of Agent Smith that emerges.  If you recall the first Matrix, Agent Smith is the most human of the agents, asking to be alone with Morpheus so he can confess his <I>desire</I> to leave the Matrix and therefore his <I>need</I> to get the codes to Zion.  My guess is that Agent Smith will have tremendous importance in the next two movies, making the bridge between humans and machines.  Anyways, more goodies like this are in the Production Notes, and I don't think it'll spoil my experience of the movie, but rather allow me to focus on other stuff rather than being distracted by confusing plot twists.</p>
