<h1>Stream of Consciousness: A transition into a Worry State</h1>

<p>first off, I don't think all my fears are warranted.</p>

<p>I guess that's part of my personality, I get ultra-worried about those things, and then I over-compensate really hard, like I really slam down hard, I guess it's insecurity.  yeah, live with it, adapt, I'll probably always have those kind of insecurities, I've had that since I was god knows how young, i'm a perpetual worrier.<br />

<br/>
<p>everything is lacking from everything, I'm not doing enough etc... yeah oh well.</p>

<p>be natural then I guess, let it go, this I know, I'm insecure as fuck, how am I going to get a girl, how blah blah, nonetheless, I don't think it's wise to respond back by controlling yourself to those goals, you have to manage through the wind, by letting go, a back and forth, an artish.  you know, no regiment, no schedules, but an understanding.</p>

<p><br />
and when I'm exhausted, frustrated, and have no energy, then that's the worst, but I think I don't feel half as bad when I have a week or something of solid production.</p>

<p>yeah, I'm terribly insecure abot money, success, results, i have to adapt to it, that's wh I am, tremendously insecure, I worry these things to death, heh, this'll probably never change.</p>

<p>yeah, adapt, so like, don't over-commit, pick a few projects that you can worry over, if they were to boil over.</p>

<p>i.e. yeah, right now, 12 units of class, worry about that, my blog, worry about that, you know, just stick with two, you got to narrow your focus.</p>

<p>yeah, yeah, employ that expedient talk.</p>

<p>yeah, it'll drive me towork out..</p>

<p>yeah, gcive up on your muscle buildin, although your healthometer, should keep going up.</p>

<p>god damn, yeah, my inecurities pound me through, I have no idea how I can handle this.  I must find a way to deal with this.<br />
a couple of ways, put some certain goals in the forefront, therefore to eliminate confusion about the small stuff.</p>

<p>things that get me most insecure: my physical state, my monetary state, my social state.</p>

<p>same deal, always been that way, yeah... hmm, I'm cycling into one of my control states, making a chart of the areas I want to work on.</p>

<p>anyways, what did I learn from that, well, it works for a little while, and then i just get exhausted and nihilistic all over again, and then the system restarts.</p>

<p>anyways... I want to maximize my physical state, yeah, god dammit, trying to do these things necessarily leads me into levels of control that I hate gettincg into, you know, that's why its' not part of my system.</p>

<p><br />
yeah, we're getting too abstract.</p>

<p>your health and shit, semi-automatic good.</p>

<p>what i want you to focus on</p>

<p><i>I choose "deeppink" because I feel like I'm simultaneously boiling and charging forward.   A thick hue suffices to show my charged state, combined with a slight hue shift giving a sense of deviation or dynamism away from an angry red to possible progress?</i></p></MTIfNotEmpty>
