<h1>The Death of Time</h1>

<p>(A comment on <a href="http://brain.blogs.com/">Abyssal Mind</a>'s post about how <a href="http://brain.blogs.com/abyssalmind/2003/10/generating_the_.html">the past is generated on the fly</a>, and that this "on the fly" is the present and is all that really exists.)</p>

<p>On a different vein, I had the same feelings this morning.  Maybe this is a thicker kind of deja-vu.<br />

<br/>
<p>I was taking a warm shower before 10am and I thought to myself, I have been taking warm showers and getting ready for school before 10AM for the past 10 years.  In addition, the night before, I found myself walking onto a lonely, empty campus and then into a classroom with flourescent lights to discuss technology and education with other like-minded people.  This is also something that I have been doing for the past 5 years or so.  Then when I got home I checked my site-stats, IM'ed and surfed the Internet, also things I've been doing for the past 5 years.</p>

<p>And then for a moment, I felt stuck in the amber of time.  I felt that I had stumbled upon time murdered.  It seemed to me that while my vantage point has changed locations throughout my "life," the point that I was looking at, primarily myself, and my requisite habits and actions, has not changed much at all.</p>

<p>If time is the distance between paradigm shifts, for humans--creatures of habit--time can cease to exist.  The colors may change and you can remember that... but take Bill Gates for example, just how much different is he now than he was 10 years ago?  He is still progressive, still hacking tech, still surrounded by monitors, probably awakens and retires at the similar times, eats similar food, and is surrounded by similar ppl.  Oh, and he's still troubled by operating systems.</p>

<p><i>(and there is this girl wearing a short jean-skirt sprawled on the floor outside my window hammering something together.  Random... sorry)</i></p>

<p><i>this post's color is chartreuse... playful, rhetorical nature, peaceful, semi-progressive, thick hue to stress awareness, alertness.</i></p></MTIfNotEmpty>
