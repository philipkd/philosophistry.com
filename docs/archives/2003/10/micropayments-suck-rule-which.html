<h1>Micropayments Suck, Rule.. which one?... who cares.</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Wednesday Oct  8, 2003  6:01 PM

<p>Clay Shirky explains why <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.html">micropayments won't work</a>... and in good philosophistric syle, employes a cool economic concept of "mental transaction costs" <i>Micropayments, like all payments, require a comparison: "Is this much of X worth that much of Y?" There is a minimum mental transaction cost created by this fact that cannot be optimized away, because the only transaction a user will be willing to approve with no thought will be one that costs them nothing, which is no transaction at all. </i><br />

<br/>
<p>Comic Book artist Scott McCloud responds with his <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/home/essays/2003-09-micros/micros.html">counter-arguments</a>, primarily because he is the target of Shirky's criticism.</p>

<p>I love the Internet for helping me see both sides of coin on many things... but at the same time... to McCloud and Shirky, why can't we just, <i>"wait and see"</i></p>

<p>Nazi Germany once posted a compendium titled, "100 scientists who think Einstein is wrong."  Einstein responded by saying, "It should only take 1 scientist if I were truly wrong."</p>

<p>McCloud's and Shirky's essays are both long on talk, but at least for McCloud, he should just go out and make lots of $ from micropayments rather than gesture loudly.....</p>

<p>...okay, maybe McCloud has something to gain by defending his system because people may read Shirky's and lose trust in him.... but really, his argument should be like a bullet point thingy, listing good counter-arguments as one-liners, and ending, "you'll see, I'll prove you wrong ;-)"</p>

<p>It's like the more someone tries the cover an emotion up, the more words that are generated to do so... i.e. this guy, in a lot of words, is saying, "you hurt my feelings Shirky"</p>

<p><i>post's color is lightgreen... green has a forward analytical attitude.  I chose a washed green though because I just woke up from a nap, so this post doesn't have as much energy into it.. though it deserves some color and whip.</i></p></MTIfNotEmpty>
