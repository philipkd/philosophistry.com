<h1>The Anti-Porn Guy</h1>

<p><i>I want to ban pornography with a 10-year prison term for viewing or participating in pornography, as well as oral and anal sex with a 1-5 year prison term for oral sex and a 1-10 year term for anal sex. I also want to ban the manufacture and sale of contraceptives (birth control) with a prison term of up to 1 year in jail and/or a fine of up to $5,000 for violating this ban. None of these laws will be retroactive. </i> (<a href="http://www.spies.com/~gus/ran/0012/antiporn/">source</a>)</p>
<h2>Comments</h2><p>Nick said on March  5, 2004 10:53 AM: <p>This is unreal - I am too angry to bombard his website with Emails. I haven't been this angry about anyone since Joseph Cassidy stole my bucket in Kindergarten.<br />
He is peddaling more or less global extermination of every minority and majority that he has no understanding of whatsoever; masquerading under the banner of good and religion, this big hairyu dogs cock wants to go out in the California sunshine and get a suntan on his pasty face; interact with normal people and get a basic understanding that people are different everywhere and he should follow the 'good books' teaching of tolerance.<br />
Alternatively, I will drug him, get his drunk, smoking cigarettes and then maybe laid - it will do him the power of good. Will someone go into his house and smash his computer and parents in who are making this idiot a non-productive member of a modern society?</p></p>
