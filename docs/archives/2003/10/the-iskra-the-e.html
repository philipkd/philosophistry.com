<h1>The Iskra?  The End of Selling Out?</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Saturday Oct 18, 2003  4:01 PM 
<br><a href="/archives/passion_pursuit.html">passion pursuit</a></h2>

<p>The idea of having a public passion is somehow bearing on me, it's interesting.</p>

<p>I don't know, well my blog is serving a totally different use you know, I'm not purely interested in hits.</p>

<p>but what I'm interested in is truly making something useful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my blog has then ceased to become about being a personal reflection of what it means to be Phil... primarily well, I think that's not what people want.</p>

<p>yeah, there's' something tricky about this perspective.</p>

<p>like, I could go back to the old style, you know, of really throwing myself out there, then it'll be a great release for me.<br />

<br/>
<p>well, true "passion" i'm limiting myself to passions that I think are useful to others as well.</p>

<p>if they're useful for others, that doesn't make it a passion, but I need to tap those passions that are public, and it serves my altruism bent.</p>

<p>like the idea of putting my life into my blog, a total slice of my mentality and thinking is interesting and cool to me, but if I saw some one else's, like, I can't focus completely on that person unless I know them, you know.  If there was a lot of emotion involved, then I'd check it out.</p>

<p>like I go to agendacide simply because I'm curious, I feel like I'm actually interfacing with the person.</p>

<p>I am passionate about expressing myself?</p>

<p>not really, I can't do a site on all personal laundry, or insight.</p>

<p>well, I'm just worried, the site is starting to seem less authentic.</p>

<p>I know, lame ass sites would make it just by posting hot links.</p>

<p>am I selling out?</p>

<p>no, not necesessssearliy, like if I genuinely care about making those kind of beats.</p>

<p>like, timbaland, I bet his passion is the actual process, and if he had to make boring beats, that'd suck completely, but I doubt that's what he has to do.</p>

<p>he does what he loves, and I'm sure there's a component in there in loving to really get people moving, at the same time, combined with his love of the art.</p>

<p>yeah, I need to emphasize public passion and private passion.</p>

<p>like, non-publically, what would I like to keep doing.</p>

<p>I'd like to just keep spitting into my blog, all my thoghts, opinons on things, random musings everything.</p>

<p>and it would feel great to me, why do I love that, I love manifesting myself onto the web, I love taking what's in here and putting it out there, it's a good feeling.</p>

<p>I would just keep writing out you know, every little random thing, every musing that came out, you know.</p>

<p>I could run an experiment for a week.</p>

<p>I'm scared about my site though.</p>

<p>you should put passion behind everything though, you know.</p>

<p>yeah, if I post shit I'm dispassionate about that sucks.</p>

<p>it's hard with technology though.</p>

<p>well, I definitely use technology to aid my passions for sure.</p>

<p>yeah, you're being very mathematic as well.</p>

<p>there should be passion behind everything I do.</p>

<p>but what if your passion is to inspire people, then you should feel tat passion in you, you should feel like, you know.</p>

<p>I guess I'm only educated about my personal passions.</p>

<p>technology is not quite the art, you know</p>

<p>well, okay whatever, I'm not ordering my thought properly.</p>

<p>there should be passion behind, at least the final project, you know, in my posts.</p>

<p>I've been writing shit on there that doesn't make sense to me., i mean it does make sense, but doesn't really you know, turn me on.</p>

<p>I mean, if I wanted to be truly passionate, I could put the girl back on there, eh, it's hard personal passion, and public utility, but do I have a desire for public utility.</p>

<p>yeah, I have total access to my personal passions, it's so easy, but it's hard for me to access the subset that is my public passions, you know.</p>

<p>yeah, I need to return back to my "roots"</p>

<p>t's a very tricky process for me.</p>

<p><br />
yeah, okay you hit on a good aspect.</p>

<p>yeah, I'm not reealy putting my passions out there in my blog.</p>

<p>I'm just re-sprouting crap out there.</p>

<p>okay, too much meta thinking.</p>

<p>so, what should I do.</p>

<p>well, Yeah, I'm seeing the limits of y curent "strategize" my blog, how can I get more stuff out there.</p>

<p>you know, I'm calculating.</p>

<p>yeah, I'm definitely throwing my passions with regard of the tech side of things' but okay.</p>

<p>yeah, I think that's a good strategy, why don't you experiment for a week, see how it goes?</p>

<p>yeah, I hear you, you're scared, scared about whether ... you know.</p>

<p>whatever, that's exacly it, you've become dependent now on the dispassionate selling-out stuffisms.</p>

<p>go back to the source, go back to the pure "passion" and not what you may calculate you might be passionate about.</p>

<p>aboost the public passions, or mark it up</p>

<p>you know, but unless you feel inside a true passion, you shouldn't be posting.</p>

<p>yeah.</p>

<p>as a rule, that makes sense with my principles.</p>

<p>like my blogfabric looks like crap lately because I'm not really posting things that feel good to me, or rather, I'm posting from these "drafts" man, screw that.</p>

<p>yeah, I don't like the drafts thing, well I tried it for a little while, it's too mechanical, I'm trying to buy my way into the popularity, that's just like running a business.</p>

<p>My blog is not a business, it's a channel for art, for self-expression, and if I go deeply into a passion, then good things will happen.</p>

<p>I'll just, if I find a passion that I think also has public utility, I should boost that one so that eventually becomes to the forefront.</p>

<p>yeah, no more stabbing in the dark, I shouldn't try to "guess" what my passions are and produce, but just start cutting from the heart.</p>

<p>I think it's worth an experiment, lets' see. .... </p>

<p>I'm nervous, I keep changing my blog.</p>

<p>hah, it reminds me of what I have to do with my life, how I keep changing my system.</p>

<p>anyways..</p>

<p>even a private passion manifest would be good enough, you know that..</p>

<p>think about the odyssey.</p>

<p>yeah, what am I doing, wasting my time.</p></MTIfNotEmpty>
