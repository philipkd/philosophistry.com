<h1>How to get free software?</h1>

<p>The following is a transcript of my ploy in order to get <A HREF=http://www.plumbdesign.com/ TARGET=_blank>plumb design</A> to give me a free copy of <A HREF=http://www.plumbdesign.com/products/thinkmap target=_blank>ThinkMap</A> to organize my thoughts.  Come on all you mega-bloggers out there, you want this kind of technology too.  When I mean "this technology" I mean a <A HREF=http://www.plumbdesign.com/thesaurus/index.html target=_blank>Visual Thesaurus</A> like organism for organizing your philosophistric archives.  If we all simultaneously pinged them for a free copy for bloggers, they'll eventually hook us up, and the world/net will be much benefitted by our efforts (thanks PJ for the inspirata)....</p>

<p>[14:15] kerstalis: tell them you just want the flash technology for personal journalizing reasons <br />
 [14:15] kerstalis: and somewhat academic in nature reasons <br />
 [14:15] kerstalis: Nietzchien, you think designers speak that language ? <br />
 [14:15] kerstalis: you're a hybrid transhumanist phil, not a down to earth designer emphaticizer. <br />
 [14:15] PhilDhingr: this is what I'm going to say now, final draft <br />
 [14:15] PhilDhingr: Why is there a form for this?  ThinkMap needs to be open-sourced and freely fed to the mega-bloggers like myself (http://www.philosophsitry.com/) who need to organize their thoughts in a new new way of thinking.  If you don't open this up or give it for free, some other kid in some other garage will and you'll become obselete.  <br />
    <br />
  Either way, can I get a free copy to experiment with my blog anyways, as a "proof-of-concept."  I swear, I will do good, Nietzschean things with it.  It's just for personal use, and it will make me very happy as it will make my shiny blog better than the next door neighbor's blog.  And isn't that what you really want to do, make some kid happy somewhere because you gave him something for free?  Please?  <br />
    <br />
  [14:15] kerstalis: tell them you just want the flash technology for personal journalizing reasons  <br />
  [14:15] kerstalis: and somewhat academic in nature reasons  <br />
  [14:15] kerstalis: Nietzchien, you think designers speak that language ?  <br />
    <br />
  these are all true too. <br />
 [14:15] PhilDhingr: I'll add the last line.</p>
