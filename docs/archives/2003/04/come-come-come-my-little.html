<p><A HREF=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/1974/script.html target=_blank>Come, come, come my little droogies</A> as we are potentially about to embark on the <A HREF=/archives/2003/04/000108.html>banality</A> of wisdom and aphorisms on Philosophistry.</p>

<p>For this post's requiem for fun-thoughtful-banter, I would like to introduce <A HREF=http://www.imaginenine.com/ target=_blank>Neil Robert Miller</A> a guest lecturer from <A HREF=http://www.stanford.edu/~smithc/quantum.html target=_blank>Quantum Theology</A>.  He is my professorial, older, whiter, alter ego.  His website is like philosophistry except ridden with academia, hippiness, age, and frolick.  Anyways, I couldn't find one of his best handouts on his site.  It's called, the "Stages of Figuring Out and Discovering the Cure."  Basically it discusses the lifecycle of magnificent ideas:</p>

<p>0.1<br />
statement of problem</p>

<p>0.6<br />
possibility</p>

<p>1.0<br />
Stage One, Simple and Innacurate<br />
Cliche: Party Talk (Building Block from the previous solution)<br />
Exciting</p>

<p>1.3<br />
Interesting<br />
Apparently</p>

<p>2.0<br />
Stage Two - Complicated and Inaccurate<br />
Philosophy: Dance, Heartbreak, Poetry, Therapy, Music<br />
Hopeless<br />
Danger</p>

<p>2.8<br />
Abysmal Deathly Failure</p>

<p>3.0<br />
Stage Three - Complicated and Accurate<br />
Science: Medicine, Therapy, Bookkeeping (did you know that this word has three consecutive pairs of the same letters?), Mathematics, Music<br />
Tedious<br />
Victory</p>

<p>3.7<br />
Permanent Satisfaction</p>

<p>4.0<br />
Stage Four - Simple and Accurate<br />
Elementary Education</p>

<p>4.2<br />
Restlessness</p>

<p>5.0<br />
Building Block: (Cliche applied to the next problem)</p>

<p>__END Imagine9__</p>

<p>In that regard, my droogies, I wonder where are we off to next?  To humor and wit--Fontenelle, Montaigne, Voltaire, and Emerson?  Or are we only going to see a small respite only to return back to the same Nietzschean style of didacticism from the nuts.  I would like to think of myself as an evolving man, one that can rise beyond the muddiness of the mundane, but then every now and then, I keep getting smacked upside the head with myself.  One things for certain, whatever I currently read affects my current mode more than anything, which either implies my talent for emulation or my talent for immersion.  If you are reading philosophistry only semi-closely, it should be obvious what book that is.  Nonetheless, I still like to think I evolve, and I hope that you too, grow out of this, this shell that you've gotten used to.</p>
