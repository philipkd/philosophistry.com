<h1>One of the biggest mistakes</h1>

<p>One of the biggest mistakes I made was to force myself to commit to being a millionaire before I was 18.  I'm about to turn 21 and I still haven't suceeded.  The result now is that there is this annoying recurring thought that I return to whenever I end up in idle situations.  If I enter a room and pause or if I have a free moment in my car, my mind goes off like the following:<br />
"I need to make a BILLION TRILLION DOLLARS"<br />
"How can I make a MILLION to the POWER OF A MILLION dollars?"<br />
"How much am I worth??"</p>

<p>This has also permeated to other f'ing annoying situations.  I go to the gym and I think, "I need to lift a BILLION JILLION pounds."  In the car it's like, "Man, I wish I could go a TRILLION light-years a second."  In a bar, party, or setting with many women, it's like, "Man, I need to ...." nevermind.</p>

<p>Either way, if you're under 21, please don't listen to those stupid documentaries with like Ross Perot or some other successful jillionaire.  I heard at least one of them say, "Yeah, when I was young, I said I'd make a million dollars before I was 18 or kill myself."  This is a stupid promise to yourself, don't do it.  It's an abuse of optimism.</p>
