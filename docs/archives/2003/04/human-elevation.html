<h1>Human Elevation</h1>

<p>Why must man seek to elevate himself.  Poetry does this all the time, painting fantasms and ghosts about the <i>great</i> human condition.  Sure, humanity is pretty great and wonderful, but reading about it does the opposite of elevation.</p>

<p>They tend to be along the lines of:<br />
<i>In the willowing wisps of silence<br />
We discovered a terrifyingly powerful force<br />
A binding nature of the highest kind<br />
We found a unity of souls</I></p>

<p>BS alert, BS alert.  Everytime I read stuff like this, I glaze over it quickly and instead dive into the subtext.  All I feel is someone wishing that such and such experience were indeed magical.  I tend to find poetry like this as a plug for the emotional void of avarice.</p>

<p>Now, if art were to bring man down to earth and expose him for the animal that he really is, wouldn't that truly have the effect of elevation?  Or is being in a postion of lust and unrequited love the desirable postition--or is this just the common position of artists?</p>

<p>Now, when I talk about reducing man to size, I'm not talking painting some guy hunched over in a dark shadow, brooding over a kill.  No, that too glorifies man.  Man must be declared simply, as he is, without the froof, exactly as he is encountered by us everyday, normal, banal, and fun.</p>
