<p>Every feature you see, every unfeature you see, any criticism you have, any praise you might lob, everything that is noticed, observed, and felt is all "intended."  You think a painting is ugly in a certain way, well then it's ugliness in that way IS part of the art; the painting is making a point about ugliness.  This is the key to understanding current "inaccessible" art.  Identify whatever you distaste and then identify whether your distaste is part of the painting's intended response.</p>

<p>A piece of art that is dishonest, that lacks intention while simultaneously lacking intended unintention, basically lacks a conscious, and therefore is of a lower art form, pretty much a designation deserving of most art out there.  If an artist has a bad voice, but uses his bad voice so that it is no longer bad, but actually good, then THAT is good art.  This is why I cut Eminem a bit higher than most other artists because he takes his faults and turns them into a form of self-mockery that becomes part of his art.</p>
