<p>What is the lifestyle?</p>

<p>In corner 1 we have Dubya.  You're straight set, early to bed early to rise, you set things in motion, you cut the heads off the thinkers and you resist temptation at every turn.</p>

<p>In corner 5 we have Nietzsche and other absurdists.  There is nothing, no way, only the way that you end up as, how you become is probably some base desire acting out, and when you die, nothing matters.</p>
