<p>Basically, this would be a discussion on the aesthetics of numbers.  (See previous <A HREF=http://www.philosophistry.com/2003_04_16_archive_index.html#200159497>"review of mundanes"</A>)</p>

<p>Like, there's a reason why he's called 007 and not 004 let's say.</p>

<p>2 is even, a solid duality, it feels simple, nice.  2 plans, 2 strategies, a forward and backup, a left and right.</p>

<p>3 is more for conviction, three points, three arguments, a argument, counter-argument, and resolution.</p>

<p>4 is never good for lists, good for maybe armies, we have four armies, three major points and a backup fourth one, four you're beginning to see plentitude, also seeing evenness, wholes.</p>

<p>5 is for handfuls, you have 5 really good ideas for you, 5 bucks vs. 4 sounds much more than 3 bucks vs. 2.</p>

<p>6 unsure about that one, not used often</p>

<p>7 of course lucky seven, if you have 7 of anything, you have more than enough.  7, since it's lack of divisibility, seems like the odd one out, if I said I had 7 friends vs. 8, there'd be a subtle oddness to it.</p>

<p>8 is the mega number.  The largest number out of all of them.</p>

<p>9 is like almost 10, the not good enough number, just there, but not quite, yet sneaky because it's the underdog.</p>

<p>10 is like the million or hundred, it's the digit multiplier, the thing where you have have a plentitude of something, more than enough to be satisfied with.  If I have 10 bucks in my pocket, I'm set.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, 1, 1 is like lonely, only, but still a hero.  Beatles 1 album, great songs.</p>

<p>And zero, of course, you see a zero, that's defeat, emptiness.  Zero solutions, nothingness.  I think 0 is feared the most out of all the numbers.</p>

<p>A good way to access the aesthetics of the number is to draw the number really big on a piece of paper and see what you feel when you look at it, from a shape-aesthetics point of view.  A big 7 on a sheet of paper, well, it looks sleek, like an arrow.  And a big 8, that looks like a lot.  And big 10, that looks like, congratulations, you're a winner.  ad infinitum.</p>
