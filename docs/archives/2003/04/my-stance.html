<h1>My stance</h1>

<p>My philosophistric stance is somewhat controversial.  A lot of my blogs sound like complete BS, almost like Nietzsche's Gay Science.  I recognize that I don't go at lengths to back up my positions with conventional academic rigour and wisdom.  Nonetheless, there is always some element of truth in each of my posts.  Even if I am completely wrong, the possibility that some unique position may be plausible makes it well worth entertaining.</p>

<p>We make a lot of shortcut decisions in life, so I find it pointless to obsess for some strict academic-like consistency.  In academic circles, I have a tendency to propose some far-out possibility, and then, instead of exploring my position with a playful curiosity and helping me fill the holes, stodgy academics just shoot me down by reiterating their perspective backed up by more things that other dead white guys have said.  I guess maybe this is to put the burden of proof on me and inspire me to research my position and come back.  <i>That</i> is BS.  I see what occurs more as a vicious cycle of inuring to conventionalism and specialization.</p>

<p>I'd rather have the tip of the iceberg of 10,000 wonderful insights than be an expert of five lame technical concepts that I can only share with the professors that are my masters.</p>
