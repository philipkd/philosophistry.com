<h1>Peddling Thoughts</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:philblog@dhingra.org">phil</a> on Monday Jun 16, 2003 11:32 AM

<p>The trumpet's in the living room of the lion's tongue.  Inside the pink peddler is trying to sell his soul to the orange biker.  Together, they form the dynamic red-orange team, an offshoot of the spiraling shitzu cult that found its home in the incisors.  They wonder about the putrid smell and hired a prophet to guess what the various smells meant.  In other words, the Lion is the God and they are the lemmings awaiting their fate.</p>

<p>Orange Speedo man, call him Carl, talks to the Red Peddler, Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Jimmy, what is it that is so important for you and your peddlings"?</p>

<p>"Carl, you don't understand.  You never will understand.  Knowledge is power and you have none.</p>

<p>"I seek intuition, I seek feeling, I seek, bikes"</p>

<p>As  Carl took his bike and moved around, the lion's tongue was tickled.  The incisors opened and closed.</p>

<p>I felt in disorder upon seeing this scene, I wanted to pull the lion's mouth open to understand why these germs were plaguing him.  He wouldn't let me, so I just took my laptop and smacked him in the face.  Fortunately, he was drugged up and not in his usual feeding frenzy, otherwise I would've been bored to death watching him feast on leftover snakes that I had put in a bucket.</p>

<p>I wonder if he has a preference, boredom or death.</p>

<p>I sat back down and I too pondered, why, why must I think?  Is there a purpose.  Does the Lion think?  What would he think if I sat on his back and started to use him as a tool for my amusement, like in an amusement park.</p>

<p>The prison gates of this cell that the Lion was in was kind of haunting, I wished I too was out.  I needed a job to get to work.  But back to the biker and the peddler.</p>

<p>The Peddler was watching the sights that would come across his mind, and the biker came back up to him, said, hey, Jimmy, why are you so dreamy?</p>

<p>"Because it helps me understand the universe"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Always with the why, and the when, and the questions, the questions"</p>

<p>"What is the most vexing question that you have to answer"</p>

<p>"I think, life"  Whathat is life for people like you and me.  I get bored sometimes man, imagination feels the spaces.</p>

<p>I try to go biking every once and a while, that's my boredom.</p>

<p>"Aren't you just buying time?"</p>

<p>"And what do you call hat you're doing"</p>

<p>"Progress"</p>

<p>Ironically, they were both paddlers, one of knowledge, the other of bikes.  Both of progress, one of the mind, the other of physical space.</p>

<p>I too, was a peddler of sorts, of drugs for this Lion.  I took it upon myself to do a handstand.   thought that maybe if I could get my shoes to touch the ceiling, gravity would be reversed.</p>

<p>But, my teacher Mr. Madkins told me something about cost-benefit analysis, and then I had to start thinking about whether it was truly beneficial to reverse gravity.</p>

<p>Beyond the gate was Kelly B.  Kelly B be the cutest lionkeeper co-worker that any teenager could dream of.</p>

<p>She liked me, I could tell.  There was something about the look in her eyes that said, "I am going to get you"</p>

<p>"Hey Phil, do you want to sleep with me?"  .. I imagined her saying.</p>

<p>I decided to be arrogant that day, I had French wine or I saw the Merovingian in the Matrix who reminded me of french.  Somehow I felt that arrogance was expedient.  I said no, a second time.</p>

<p>"No, no"</p>

<p>"What are you saying no about?"</p>

<p>"I'm frustrated with this lion, it has terrible germs, and I can't clean them"</p>

<p>"Let me help and massage your back" ... I imagined her saying.</p>

<p>She opened the prison walls and sat next to me, thinking, understanding.</p>

<p>I decided I would touch her, but I didn't.  Kelly B started to talk, or at least move her mouth open and closed.  She had gum in her mouth, pink gum I could tell.  She did that thing where she takes the chewed gum, puts it halfway outside of her mouth in between her incisors so somehow someone else could see it.</p>

<p>I didn't think it wsa attractive at all, this extra tongue that was coming out.</p>

<p>"What do you want to do tonight?"</p>

<p>... this I wasn't imagining her saying.  I hoped.  I responded anyways, but gave a vague response so that if I was wrong, it could look like I was talking to myself.</p>

<p>"Go to the movies."</p>

<p>Apparently I failed in that ambiguous statement.</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>Good, she did ask me.</p>

<p>"I want to see, Tiger Eat Cantalopes"</p>

<p>"Wasn't that on Discovery?"</p>

<p>I decided to invoke arrogance again and remained silent.</p>

<p>Silent except for the chewing and the rustling of the Lion.</p>

<p>Water started to seep into the room, it got my feet wet.  Kelly kind of was stressed out by it.  I fancied that maybe I had somehow changed gravity enough so that a new tide came in.  That would've been nice, to change the sea through gravity.  I herad the moon does that occasionally.</p>

<p>Bac kto the Peddlers.</p>

<p>"Carl, why are you so gay?"</p>

<p>"Please, none of that derogatory stuff.  It's bad enough that the incisor people won't talk to me, and now I have you."</p>

<p>"Aight, I'm just making conversations."</p>

<p>Why wouldn't Kelly B sleep with me.</p>

<p>"What, excuse me, did you say something?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, why is the canopy opening over me?"</p>

<p>"Is that why you think it's getting wet?"</p>

<p>No, I bet you're getting wet.</p>

<p>pause...</p>

<p>good, she didn't hear that.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to see the supervisor."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you go do that"</p>

<p>"No need to be so sarcastic Phil."</p>

<p>"Uh, um... OKAY Kelly"</p>

<p>Kelly left and I was all alone with the lion, the water, and the peddlers.  I wonder if I could speak with the peddlers.</p>
