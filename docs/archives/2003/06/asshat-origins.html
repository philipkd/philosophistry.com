<h2>Comments</h2><p>Benjamin said on December 22, 2003  8:46 AM: <p>Does anyone know how old is the yin/yang fish-shaped symbol?  Has it been around since the Tang Dynasty?</p>

<p>I'm asking this because I met a soldier in the US Army whose unit had that same symbol (the fish shaped yin-yang symbol without the eyes).  He was told by his commander that his unit had been using this symbol before the Chinese started using it.  I found this hard to swallow since the US Army was established in the late 1700s and I figured that the yin/yang symbol must have been around longer than that.</p>

<p>Anyway, there's a whole battalion of soldiers who honestly believe that their unit was the first to draw up the yin/yang symbol which was later swiped by the Chinese.  </p>

<p>So, can anyone tell me how old is the yin/yang fish symbol?  Did it appear in any shrine, paintings, or cave drawings?  Does anyone know if the Australopithecines may have used it? (just kidding).   :-)</p></p>
