<h1>so..</h1>

<p>a guy walks into the bar.</p>

<p>No, so, I'm sitting in the library, you know, minding my own business.  I lean back, do a yawn thing, glance the scene see if there's anybody I know.  Well, at 8 O'Clock, I glanced and saw this adonis....</p>

<p>side note: remember fight club?  remember the blond guy who Ed Norton beat the shit out because he wanted to destroy something beautiful, well, this person is like that.</p>

<p><br />
... He/she has very thin blond hair that hangs around the side, either like a short woman's haircut or a man with long hair.  It's very shiny and almost white.  Well I couldn't tell whether this person was a man or not.  He/she was behind a computer screen so I could only see his/her face and that his/her legs were crossed.  Now, I can't just glance over, he's not in my 135 degrees field of vision.  I don't want to lean back and creak my neck to catch a glance either, cuz, if it's a guy, then I'm checking out a guy, not cool.</p>

<p>dilemmas, dilemmas</p>

<p>UPDATE: I did manage to glance.  Somebody walked into the rear door so that's an excuse to turn your head, I couldn't fixate too long, but I catched the very hairy leg-hair, an instant mark of the manbeast.  I'm done, and killing time.</p>
