<div class="title">How primate diets may explain their relatively large brains</div>


<p class="no-indent">One of the most fundamental philosophical challenges is understanding where we came from.  In particular, humans seek to understand how they obtained the special traits of intelligence and consciousness that distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom.  Modern science has revealed that the brain is the seat of intelligence, so those who seek an answer to our unique origins need look no further than at the evolution of brains in our primate ancestors.  Specialists in encephalization-the technical term for "evolutionary brain development"-have attempted to correlate ecological and biological variables to the relatively large brain sizes of primates.  Some theories focus on the social behavior of primates, while others focus on physiological characteristics like enhanced color vision.  This paper emphasizes the role of primate diet in encephalization by covering four theories: The food-extraction hypothesis, the mental map hypothesis, the ephemeral food supply hypothesis, and the expensive-tissue hypothesis.  All of these hypotheses provide a glimpse at how we became the way we are.</p>

<div class="header1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEOCORTEX</div>
<p class="no-indent">The increased size of the neocortex in primates is largely responsible for the increased size of their brains relative to other primates (Allman 1999, Jerison 1973, 1979).  "Neocortex" is Latin meaning "new bark" which is fitting as this part of the brain covers its outer regions.  Encephalization specialists focus on the neocortex because they believe it is responsible for more advanced capabilities of primates (Allman 1999, Sawaguchi 1989, Fish 2003).  Studies separate between parts of the brain which are used for primitive functions-such as maintaining heart rate, breathing, and balance-and advanced functions which spring from the neocortex.  Primatologists measure the indices of extra cortical parts (ECIs) which are indicative of the size of parts of the cerebral cortex that are associated with advanced functions.  ECIs are hence indicative of the degree of cortical expansion (Jerison 1973, Sawaguchi 1989).</p>

<p>The neocortex is important for understanding the way primates deal with their environments.  According to Gibson (1978), "the neocortex perceives tactile, visual and auditory images by breaking down sensory images into fine component parts and then reassembling them to construct complex perceptual whole."  Such skills could be used for fine differentiated movements such as navigating complex environments like the trees of the jungle, or in using individual limbs and fingers with precision.  The neocortex would enable planning, execution, and coordination of a sequence of movements of many body parts, like using two hands in manipulating an object or in carrying out a complicated process to reach a goal.  A simple comparison between amphibians and primates shows the differences in the complexity required.  A frog, for example, simply has to recognize a bug, shoot out its tongue, and swallow.  A primate, on the other hand, which, in most species are fruit-eaters, would have to determine the ripeness of a fruit, possibly by handling it, then discriminate between edible and non-edible parts (i.e. a banana peel), and then contract jaw muscles in patterns to chew the fruit (Gibson 1987).  This is one example of the importance of the neocortex for primates in meeting their dietary requirements.  Below are four specific hypotheses for the correlation between neocortex size and primate diet.</p>

<div class="header1">THE FOOD-EXTRACTION HYPOTHESIS</div>
<p class="no-indent">Primate diets depend on extracting foodstuffs of high nutritional value.  This involves the complicated usage of advanced anatomical functions.  Gibson, who is credited (Rifkin 1995) with this hypothesis, provides a great description worth quoting verbatim:
<blockquote>
Extractive foraging means feeding on foods that must first be removed from other matrices in which they are embedded or encased.  Extractive foods include nut-meat, shellfish, snails, eggs, brains or bone marrow which must be removed from hard outer coverings, seeds and beans that must be removed from pods, tubers or roots that must be dug from the ground, nuts and termites that must be removed from mounds or hills, insect larvae or pith that must be extracted from bark, and meat that is extracted from its hide prior to ingestion. (Gibson 1987)
</blockquote></p>

<p>For millions of years, these embedded foodstuffs were previously locked behind those shells and bones.  During the Mesozoic Era (the pre-primate and pre-mammalian era from 251 to 65 million years ago), dinosaurs and reptiles without these advanced functions could not easily extract the nutritional value of embedded foods.  After the theoretical meteor Chicxulub wiped out the dinosaurs, mammals radiated out in large populations to fill up the newly available niches during the Paleozoic Era (65 million years ago to present). Angiosperms, or fruit-bearing plants, also radiated out during the Paleozoic, providing an open niche for embedded foodstuffs.  The primate neocortex therefore aided in the primate's occupation of a previously unoccupied and newly enriched niche of embedded foods.</p>

<p>The occupation of the embedded food niche by species outside of the Class Mammalia also provides insight into the relation between brain size and diet.  Parrots and crows have an increased part of their forebrain which may be related to their ability to use tools to extract food (Emery & Clayton 2004).  This might be an example of a convergent trait in evolution.  A convergent trait is an adaptation independently developed in a separate species that confer the same benefits.  Evidence for a convergent trait, such as food-extraction, and its relationship to the expansion of the brain bolsters the hypothesis that brain size and a diet based on embedded foods are related.  This evidence, combined with the aforementioned complicated nature of food-extraction also furthers the hypothesis that increased brain-size in primates is an adaptation to tap the niche provided by embedded foods.</p>

<div class="header1">THE MENTAL MAP HYPOTHESIS</div>
<p class="no-indent">In addition to food-extraction requirements, a fruit-based diet also requires extra capabilities in locating food.  Fruit-based diets require longer home ranges than leaf-based diets due to the scattered and clumped distribution of fruits.  Foraging for fruits therefore requires storing a mental map in the mind so as to revisit food sources over time.  Processing such data would require a relatively larger brain (Brock & Harvey 1980, Deacon 1990, Rifkin 1995, Aiello & Wheeler 1995).  To test this hypothesis, Clutton-Brock and Harvey (1980) discovered among primate species a positive correlation between the size of a species's home range and their brain size.  This analysis is important because it compares brain sizes among primates themselves, rather than just looking at the large brains of primates overall.  This comparative analysis reveals a tighter relationship between brain size and home ranges.  Since home range is dictated largely by the necessities of meeting a primate diet, then a larger mental map would be required for successful feeding.</p>

<p>The "mental map hypothesis" wouldn't be anything without proof that primates do posses mental maps.  Boesch (1984) discovered the existence of mental maps in chimpanzees, for example.  Also, Sigg tested (1986) the existence of a mental map in hamadryas baboons by analyzing the routes they take.  He found that they seek out intermediate positions on a trail and have a sense of general direction of a target, like a water-hole.  This implies that a mental map of food sources would also require a map of intermediate points in order to reach destinations.  The complexity and storage space required for mental maps therefore grows with the size of the mental map.</p>

<div class="header1">THE EPHEMERAL FOOD SUPPLY HYPOTHESIS</div>
<p class="no-indent">Relatively larger brain sizes for primates may be an adaptation to the ephemeral, or short-term and sparse nature of fruit-based diets.  The ephemeral food supply hypothesis states that food sources that are rarer require extra cognitive capacities to monitor their availability, memorize time sequences, and store, as mentioned earlier, a mental map (Clutton-Brock and Harvey 1980, Milton 1988, Rifkin 1995).  The infrequency of fruit-bearing trees adds a time-dimension to mental maps.  Orangutans, for example, will return back to the same exact fruit-bearing tree at the same time of the year when the fruits are ripe.  Such map-based thinking requires more complexity of thought, which as mentioned earlier, requires a larger neocortex.</p>

<p>The special way great apes evolved in response to drastic climatic changes further bolsters the ephemeral food supply hypothesis.  During the end of the Eocene and around the start of the Oligocene eras thirty million years ago, the Earth cooled down which reduced tropical rain forests and made the earth more arid.  Dry woodlands with grass clearings spread across latitudes away from the equator.  Mass extinctions in mammals occurred at this time so the response in the evolution of primates is revealing:
<blockquote>
Once apes were confined to equatorial settings, therefore, habitat instability heightened the spatial/temporal uncertainty of ripe-fruit sources. Prolonged learning, the assignment of attributes to distant places, mental representation, and reliance on fallback foods were all favored in this dynamic environmental context. These abilities helped sustain forest frugivory in most lineages. Fluid social grouping afforded the animals opportunities to locate ephemeral foods in continuous and fragmented forests. Fissionfusion grouping also magnified the problems of object impermanence (of individuals) and dispersion manifested by food sources in the ecological realm. Thus the spatial and temporal dynamics of fruit and wooded habitats since the Miocene are reflected in important components of great ape cognition, foraging, and sociality. (Potts 209)
</blockquote>
The climate changes of the Eocene and Oligocene eras made food supplies for apes even more ephemeral.  By the ephemeral food supply hypothesis, apes and other primates dependent on fruits would have to further enhance their existing skills or develop new skills in order to avoid extinction.  Since their adaptation to varying food supplies was in increased intelligence, climate changes only further accentuated primate intelligence.
</p>

<p>Other fruit-eaters in the food kingdom demonstrate memory-capabilities, and so perhaps fruit-based diets cannot be the only pressure requiring intelligence (Rifkin 1995).</p>

<div class="header1">THE EXPENSIVE-TISSUE HYPOTHESIS</div>
<p class="no-indent">Aiello and Wheeler (1995) formulated a more recent hypothesis on diet's affect on encephalization called the expensive-tissue hypothesis.  While this has been largely intended to describe the rapid expansion of neocortex mass in hominids, further research has corroborated its efficacy in underpinning the importance of biological constraints in primate evolution.</p>

<p>Looking at how the primate body compensates for the high energy demands of larger brains reveals more about the relationship between diet and brain size.  The primate body, like any machine, requires sources of energy or fuel to run its various components.  In primates, the fuel comes from food which supplies the calories needed by the organs.  Some organs, like the brain for example, demand more calories than other organs.  The primate brain requires nine times the amount of energy than parts of the body of equal size.  This is due to the energy requirements of neurons, the lack of energy stores, and the brain's requirement of high levels of oxygen (Armstrong 1983, Aiello & Wheeler 1995).  Assuming that the primate's diet stays constant for its body-size, increases in the brain's energy requirements must be compensated by reductions in the energy available to other organs.  This assumption can be made.  Kleiber (1961) invented a formula for predicting the basal-metabolic rate (BMR), which is like the energy required for an animal to live, based on the mass of the animal.  Aiello and Wheeler's (1995) investigations revealed that a version of Kleiber's formula specific to placental mammals showed that there was no extra increase in the BMR of primates without a corresponding increase in body size.  The relatively large brain sizes for primates are thus compensated by decreased energy requirements of other organs.</p>

<p>	The organ that is reduced to compensate for the brain is the gut, a metabolically expensive organ.  The gut was singled out because other expensive organs, including the heart, the liver, kidneys, and skeletal muscle cannot be reduced relative to body size (Aiello & Wheeler 1995).   Aiello and Wheeler's graphs also show a negative correlation between relative gut mass and relative brain mass and primates, which strengthens the point that a reduced gut size and an increased brain size coevolved in primates.  The size of the gut has important implications for the diet of primates.</p>

<p>	Since large brains require smaller guts, and since the size of the gut largely determines what can be consumed, brain size and diet must be linked (Milton 1993).  Diets characterized by large quantities of food of low digestibility, such as leaves and grasses, require large guts with huge and elaborate fermenting chambers (stomach and/or small intestine), such as found in cows.  Conversely, diets characterized by smaller quantities of food of high digestibility, like meat, require relatively smaller guts.  There is a similar correlation in primates (Aiello & Wheeler 1995).  Fish (2003) applied another formula for the dietary quality in order to find a correlation between diet and brain size.  The "index of dietary quality" rates meat as the highest quality, fruits as the second highest, and leaves as the lowest.  This ranking reflects the difficulty in digesting and extracting calories from each of those sources.  Her results indicate that dietary quality is strongly correlated with brain mass.  Bigger brains mean better diets, or easier to digest foods.  To illustrate this point, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, with the largest relative brain mass of the primates, are extremely discriminate in what they eat.  They also prepare food through cooking and refrigeration, making food items even easier to digest.  As a result, we can have smaller guts and support larger brains.</p>

<p>If primate intelligence was applied to improving the quality of diet, and improved quality of diet allows for larger brains, we find a positive feedback loop.  A larger brain could lead to better sensory motor skills, such as digging, picking, and peeling to allow for more discriminate extraction of foodstuffs.  Other skills, such as forming groups, could enhance the information that the primate has in discovering quality food; tool-making in hominids helped in hunting; complex navigation of trees helps and memory help increase the range that primates can cover for food.  As all of these features develop, the quality of the diet improves.  The better the quality of the diet, the smaller the gut can be.  In practice, this could have been spawned through sexual selection pressures for smarter than average mates and primates with smaller gut-sizes, which maybe explains the rapid encephalization from the end of dinosaurs onward.</p>


<div class="header1">OTHER THEORIES</div>
<p class="no-indent">Other theories on primate encephalization involve an analysis of primate social skills.  One theory falls under the title "Machiavellian intelligence" which involves the ability of primates to mentalize and manipulate other members of the same species (Milton 1988).  Anthropoids also show differences in social structure (i.e. single-male polygyny, multimale polygyny and monogyny structures) (Sawaguchi 1989), which can be analyzed with regard to their demands on cognitive complexity.  Another theory not included in this paper identifies the cognitive demands of understanding the language of the colors of fruit skins in order to determine ripeness-a skill that primates apparently exhibit.  Ultimately, different lineages may have different applicable hypotheses, requiring more comparative analyses.</p>

<div class="header1">CONCLUSION AND A LOOK AT THE FUTURE</div>
<p class="no-indent">The link between primates' diet and their relatively large brain sizes is scratching the surface of the causes of primate encephalization.  Contemporary advances in molecular biology, such as sequencing primate genomes and the increased collaboration among institutions via the Internet, should provide more convincing theories.  The quantity and quality of information in Primatology is growing exponentially as can be seen through an information explosion within the past ten years.  Revisiting this topic in ten years should provide more novel and concrete suggestions as to how primates evolved large brains.  One of the areas that I noticed lacking was comparative discussions; the more recent paper cited by Emery and Clayton (2004) looks at intelligence among other zoological families, such as birds.  Science is also making great strides in brain research and may eventually provide for the monitoring of the brain in real-time at the neuron-level of resolution.  However, it seems that for every answer we discover about out origins, the more questions we have.</p>
