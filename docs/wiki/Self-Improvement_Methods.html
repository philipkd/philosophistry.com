<p>An inventory of self-improvement methods that I've kept up for more than a year, as of Dec 2018. A "¹" means its inactive.</p>

<h1>Inventory</h1>

<h2>Device-manipulation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Put your alarm away from your bed</li>
<li>Don't ever put your car keys on the chair, on the floor of the car, or in the trunk — <em>Never lock yourself out</em></li>
<li>Use an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077SXWSRP/?tag=philosophistr-20">Echo Show</a> to reach out to loved ones who aren't good with phones</li>
<li>Keep a hand sanitizer where you place your keys</li>
<li>Charge your phone away from your bed¹ — <em>Great for getting yourself out of bed, but phones are also good for distracting away from over-introspection</em></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/dear-hannah/my-first-time-with-a-breathalyzer-97651f7a47c2">Keep a breathalyzer in your car</a>¹</li>
</ul>

<h2>Do something deliberately</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drive chill or kind of slowly</li>
<li>Hold your razor loose to prevent nicks</li>
<li>When the floor is slippery, twist your ankles to calibrate how slippery your shoes are — <em>Useful in icy conditions</em></li>
<li>When the road is slippery, slam on the brakes to calibrate how slippery it is</li>
</ul>

<h2>Repeatedly invoke a system</h2>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KK0PICK/?tag=philosophistr-20">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a></em></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/dear-hannah/applying-character-counts-to-my-life-fec22927289d">Character Counts</a>¹</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/dear-hannah/one-way-to-find-your-passion-3e5bb3a062c8">Aspiration Method</a>¹</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q1SQCQ/?tag=philosophistr-20">The Memory Book</a></em>¹ — <em>Only needed it in High School</em></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/dear-hannah/changes-to-my-life-after-a-few-weeks-of-cognitive-therapy-f75ebaedb76b">Cognitive therapy</a>¹ — <em>The main benefit may just be in the first six months</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>100%-compliance rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>Brush your teeth every night — <em>Otherwise, seeking 99% compliance leads to 85%</em></li>
<li>Turn on your headlights every time you start the car — <em>Studies show that cars with headlights on by default are safer</em></li>
<li>Stop all-the-way at stop signs</li>
<li>Never use the knob lock when closing doors — <em>Most easily preventable source of lockouts</em></li>
<li>Always drive the speed limit¹ — <em>You'll never get a ticket</em></li>
<li>Drink a maximum of 1 drink per day¹ - <em>Drinks plural is a whole different limit</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Appropriate uses of writing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Put receipts for grocery purchases or leftovers on your fridge, then cross off items you eat</li>
<li><a href="images/meditation-calendar.png">Cross off every day you meditate</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/dear-hannah/why-i-gave-up-diaries-bb13e6a7051b">Don't journal your introspections</a></li>
<li>Write an x in your phone for every drink you plan on having that night, then delete an x for every drink you have</li>
<li>Take the first two numbers of your monthly spending and convert all purchases into a point-system¹ — <em><a href="https://medium.com/@philipkd/how-i-finally-reined-in-my-spending-a1255a6f2736">It made me penny-wise, pound-foolish</a></em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Frictionless timers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Timed stretching: use an Apple Watch to set <em>n</em>-sec timers for stretches</li>
<li>Set a 1-min. timer for brushing your teeth at night</li>
</ul>

<h2>"Laziness is good"</h2>

<ul>
<li>Take the path of least resistance when dealing with red tape — <em>Sometimes I just resubmit paperwork with a few changes to see if it will get through</em></li>
<li>Do as many stretches as you feel like at the gym</li>
<li>Place hand on diaphragm while obsessing in bed — <em>Serves as a pseudo-meditation</em></li>
<li><em>Only</em> brush your teeth for 1 minute every night — <em>Otherwise, attempting 2 minutes in the morning and at night leads to non-compliance</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>March-to-your-own-beat health practices</h2>

<ul>
<li>High-rep weight-lifting: do 20-plus reps until tired or failure per muscle group</li>
<li>Only wash armpits, groin, and feet in the shower</li>
<li>Use hand sanitizer after touching serving utensils at buffet tables or when at mixers with hors-d'oeuvres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Do something <em>here</em> that leads to something <em>there</em></h2>

<ul>
<li>Reduce fapping for increased game</li>
<li>Avoid porn for increased game¹ — <em>Uncertain if this or low-fapping is the key</em></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/dear-hannah/8-changes-to-my-life-after-just-4-weeks-of-meditation-535bbab183d5">Daily breath-monitoring meditation</a> for reduced anxiety</li>
<li>Daily pseudo-meditations for reduced anxiety</li>
</ul>

<h2>Periodicity</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/dear-hannah/8-changes-to-my-life-after-just-4-weeks-of-meditation-535bbab183d5">Practice 30-min. of breath-monitoring meditation daily</a></li>
<li>Practice 15-min. daily of pseudo-meditations, such as using the sauna or sound baths</li>
<li>Every 3 months collect your income statements and itemize them</li>
<li>Every 15 days categorize your expenses on <a href="https://mint.com/">Mint</a></li>
<li>Execute the <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KK0PICK/?tag=philosophistr-20">Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a></em> system yearly¹</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-imposed carrots-on-stick</h2>

<ul>
<li>e.g. "I'll only watch TV tonight if I brush my teeth first"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Do the small, easy steps first</h2>

<ul>
<li>e.g. Open your bills and throw away the envelopes first</li>
</ul>

<h2>Place objects where you want them to remind you</h2>

<ul>
<li>e.g. Putting your mail by the foot of your door, so you remember to take it on the way out</li>
</ul>

<h1>Definition of method</h1>

<p><strong>method</strong>: a neologism for any mantra, system, shortcut, life-hack, or idea that you repeat in your head in order to bring about a desired behavior.</p>

<p><strong>method abuse</strong>: when you repeat a method so much that it does more harm than good.</p>

<p>Methods are like programs you run in your brain. They operate much like daemons, which are continuously running programs, like servers.</p>

<p>Self-improvement methods are also similar to method acting, whereby an actor summons a memory or trigger in order to have their behavior naturally match the emotions that a scene requires.</p>

<h2>Habits vs. methods</h2>

<p>Habits aren't the same as methods. For example, I have a habit of organizing my bed every day. Even though I don't want to, most of the time, I nudge myself to do it every day, and it happens that I make my bed every day. I have no rule that I need to do it; it's just that it bothers me when I see it messy. Habits are natural and self-renewing, whereas a method occurs when you have to make a conscious and deliberate effort to renew the practice.</p>
