<h1>Definitions</h1>

<ul>
<li><em>absence reporting:</em> identifying objects that are absent</li>
<li><em>cooperative problem-solving:</em> i.e. elephants coordinating the simultaneous pulling of a rope for a reward</li>
<li><em>double-articulation:</em> layered, dual-meaning in language. In humans this means phonemes at the bottom with words at the top</li>
<li><em>meta-cognition:</em> thinking about thinking</li>
<li><em>numerical continuity:</em> recognizing that 1 and 2 are followed by 3 and 4</li>
<li><em>play:</em> self-directed or group-directed creative learning</li>
<li><em>pointing:</em> communicate an object by extending or recognizing an extension of an extremity like a finger or trunk</li>
<li><em>improvisation:</em> i.e. dolphins being rewarded for novel gestures</li>
<li><em>self-awareness:</em> mirror tests where animal knows its them, usually by a mark on their face</li>
<li><em>sentence-comprehension:</em> recognizing arbitrarily long and unique chains of words</li>
<li><em>syntax:</em> languages with grammars</li>
<li><em>tiered alliances:</em> fission-fusion societies require tracking multiple alliances (i.e. squads versus herds), which is <em>society</em> as humans know it</li>
<li><em>vocal signatures:</em> recognizing the "names" of known acquaintances through voice</li>
<li><em>working memory:</em> integrating different time-layers of memories into the present, such as how elephants can track multiple family members in different locations with associations to past events, such as droughts</li>
</ul>

Eurasian magpie: self-awareness

Greater spot-nosed monkey: syntax

Elephants: altruism, learning (?), cooperation, memory, communication, grief

Many apes, including Washoe and Nim the chimps, and Kanzi the bonobo, have learned to communicate by using sign language or symbols on a keyboard. Alex, an African grey parrot learned over 100 English words, which he could use and combine appropriately; his poignant last words to Irene Pepperberg, his scientist handler, were “You be good. I love you. See you tomorrow.”

Dolphins can recognize their old tank mates’ whistles after being separated for more than 20 years—the longest social memory ever recorded for a non-human species.

The remarkable memory feat is another indication that dolphins have a level of cognitive sophistication comparable to only a few other species, including humans, chimpanzees and elephants.
