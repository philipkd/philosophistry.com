<h1>Positive side of</h1>

<p>While apathy increases with larger states, so does mass activism, which is how we ultimately address local injustices.</p>

<p>The problem with large states is that motivation is so diffuse. When there are millions of voters, it's irrational to go to the polls. On the other hand, with a larger state, gross local injustices can accumulate enough small bits of regional ire to generate a unique, mass-scale response that would have otherwise been impossible, such as in the nationwide response that descended on Rosa Parks.</p>

<h1>Apathetic consent</h1>

<p>Democracy is less representational than begrudging consent. The state takes as much from the people without annoying them collectively enough that they become informed, vote with full participation, and toss the rulers out of office.</p>
