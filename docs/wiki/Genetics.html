<h1>Mechanics</h1>

<h2>From DNA to proteins</h2>

<p>The genetic code is a 3 billion-character string written in base-4.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous bases are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. A base pair includes two nucleotides, and a nucleotide consists of a sugar, phosphate, and one of the notrogenous bases. Each base pair includes two molecules, either a pair of AT (adenine-thymine) or CG (cytosine-guanine). The orientation of the pair matters, leading to two bits, or four possible combinations per base pair.</p>

<p>Three base pairs form a codon (or triplet). Each codon codes an amino acid. 64 possible codons (2 bits ^ 3). There are only 20 amino acids, so multiple codons can make an amino acid.</p>

<p>A protein is a string of ~50 amino acids, bounded by a stop and ending codon.</p>

<p>"It seems to be a matter of five or six proteins, on average, from one gene."  - McKusick</p>

<p>A gene is a sequence of DNA, so maybe 900 base pairs (6 proteins * 50 amino acids * 3). It comes out to 448 base pairs per gene using the mDNA math below. A gene codes for a molecule that has a function.</p>

<p>An allele is a variant of a gene. The most common is variant type is dominant-recessive, where the recessive gene simply doesn't code for a functional protein, but still causes a phenotypical change.</p>

<p>The human genome is composed of 19,000-20,000 human protein-coding genes.</p>

<p>2.9 billion DNA base pairs that make up the human genome. Essentially ~6 billion molecules (nitrogenous bases) make up our DNA.</p>

<h2>Packing</h2>

<p>146 base pairs pack into a nucleosome, so maybe one nucleosome per protein. Nucleosomes pack into chromatines. Chromatines pack into chromatine loops. Chromatine loops become 23 chromosomes.</p>

<h2>Gene expression</h2>

<p>There are 200 different types of cells in the human body, and about 20 different types of structures or organelles within those cells.</p>

<h2>Mitochondria</h2>

<p>"In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth." [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion">wikipedia</a>]</p>

<p>16,569 base pairs of mDNA encode for 37 genes.</p>

<h1>Features and genes</h1>

<p>Every feature existed for the first time in some ancestor. All of the features that define what it means to be human existed for the first time through billions of first-ancestors, going all the way back to LUCA (the last universal common ancestor), a small single-celled organism.</p>

<p>Intelligence is a feature. So is number-counting, even though number-counting is a form of intelligence. The word "feature" here is used instead of "trait" because trait commonly refers just to alleles, such as the eye-color alleles. In our terminology, blue eyes are a feature, just as the feature of having pigments are a feature, and just as having an iris. There was a first-ancestor with blue eyes, a first-ancestor with pigments in their iris, and a first-ancestor with an iris.</p>

<p>Einstein had a large helping of abstract thinking necessary to come up with the Theory of Relativity. He may have been the first-ancestor of just the size of his abstract thinking, or maybe someone further up the tree had that size. That size of abstract thinking may have shown up in someone else for whom their common ancestor may be many more generations behind Einstein's first ancestor who had that size of abstract thinking.</p>

<p>Here, we use the phrase "show up" as opposed to "evolve". Evolve connotates mutation and recombination. Mutations are very infrequent. Recombination has to be the main engine for new, polymorphic features. A highly polygenic feature, such as intelligence, "mutates" with every individual, producing brand new intelligences with every child. However, eye color is not very polygenic, and therefore eye-color evolution <em>is</em> indeed bound by genetic mutation.</p>
