<h1>Basepairs</h1>

<p>The genetic code is a 3 billion-character string written in base-4.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous bases are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. A base pair includes two nucleotides, and a nucleotide consists of a sugar, phosphate, and one of the notrogenous bases. Each base pair includes two molecules, either a pair of AT (adenine-thymine) or CG (cytosine-guanine). The orientation of the pair matters, leading to two bits, or four possible combinations per base pair.</p>

<p>Three base pairs form a codon (or triplet). Each codon codes an amino acid. 64 possible codons (2 bits ^ 3). There are only 20 amino acids, so multiple codons can make an amino acid.</p>

<p>A protein is a string of ~50 amino acids, bounded by a stop and ending codon.</p>

<p>"It seems to be a matter of five or six proteins, on average, from one gene."  - McKusick</p>

<h1>Genes</h1>

<p>A gene is a sequence of DNA, so maybe 900 base pairs (6 proteins * 50 amino acids * 3). It comes out to 448 base pairs per gene using the mDNA math below. A gene codes for a molecule that has a function.</p>

<p>An allele is a variant of a gene. The most common is variant type is dominant-recessive, where the recessive gene simply doesn't code for a functional protein, but still causes a phenotypical change.</p>

<p>The human genome is composed of 19,000-20,000 human protein-coding genes.</p>

<p>2.9 billion DNA base pairs that make up the human genome. Essentially ~6 billion molecules (nitrogenous bases) make up our DNA.</p>

<h2>Functional composition</h2>

<p>"Only 1.5 percent of the DNA in the genome actually codes for genes." [<a href="https://www.learner.org/interactives/dna/project6.html">source</a>]</p>

<p>"protein-coding sequences, which are what we mostly mean when we say 'genes,' occupy only a little over 1% of the human genome." [<a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/08/05/how-much-of-human-dna-is-doing-something/">Powledge</a>]</p>

<p>"8% is nearly all regulatory sequences" (Powledge)</p>

<h2>Packing</h2>

<p>146 base pairs pack into a nucleosome, so maybe one nucleosome per protein. Nucleosomes pack into chromatines. Chromatines pack into chromatine loops. Chromatine loops become 23 chromosomes.</p>

<h2>Gene expression</h2>

<p>There are 200 different types of cells in the human body, and about 20 different types of structures or organelles within those cells.</p>

<h1>Mitochondria</h1>

<p>"In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth." [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion">wikipedia</a>]</p>

<p>16,569 base pairs of mDNA encode for 37 genes.</p>
