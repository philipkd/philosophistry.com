<p>While intelligence is not strictly defined, we have a vague, collective definition. Science writers regularly produce rankings of intelligent species. Wikipedia also keeps inventories of cognitive features for well-known species. For example, elephants exhibit pointing, mimicry, and self-awareness. These social lists, when merged, resemble a hierarchy where the species with the most cognitive features number the least, whereas the species with the least cognitive features number the most.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tier 1 (Generalist): humans</p></li>
<li><p>Tier 2 (Clever): chimpanzees, elephants, octopus, dolphins, dogs</p></li>
<li><p>Tier 3 (Smart): pigs, monkeys, squids</p></li>
<li><p>Tier 4: crows, parrots, squirrels, et. al</p></li>
<li><p>Tier 5 (Specialist): spiders, et. al.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: without human intervention, wolves (which evolved into dogs) would likely be Tier 3.</p>

<h1>Timescales</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Humans diverged from chimpanzees 6 ma (million years ago).</p></li>
<li><p>The biggest group of what we consider smart animals are smart mammals, whose common ancestor are placental mammals (90 ma).</p></li>
<li><p>There are no marsupials (87 ma) in tiers 4 and above. Marsupials branched out from Therian mammals (160 ma). Therians give birth without using a shelled egg.</p></li>
<li><p>Octopi and humans share a common ancestor of Nephrozoa (560 ma), which all have bilateral symmetry. There are no intelligent species outside of Nephrozoa.</p></li>
</ul>
