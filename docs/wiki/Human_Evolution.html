<h1>Significant events</h1>

<ul>
<li>Y-chromosomal Adam: 200,000-300,000 ya</li>
<li>Mitochondrial Eve: 120,000-156,000</li>
<li>Invention of fire: 1,700,000-200,000</li>
<li>Behavioral modernity (abstract planning, symbolic behavior, large game hunting): 40,000-50,000</li>
<li>Literacy (See: <a href="Evolution_of_Literacy">Evolution of Literacy</a>): 10,000</li>
<li>Beringia submerged: 10,000</li>
</ul>

<h1>Features and genes</h1>

<p>Every feature existed for the first time in some ancestor. All of the features that define what it means to be human existed for the first time through billions of first-ancestors, going all the way back to LUCA (the last universal common ancestor), a small single-celled organism.</p>

<p>Intelligence is a feature. So is number-counting, even though number-counting is a form of intelligence. The word "feature" here is used instead of "trait" because trait commonly refers just to alleles, such as the eye-color alleles. In our terminology, blue eyes are a feature, just as the feature of having pigments are a feature, and just as having an iris. There was a first-ancestor with blue eyes, a first-ancestor with pigments in their iris, and a first-ancestor with an iris.</p>

<p>Einstein had a large helping of abstract thinking necessary to come up with the Theory of Relativity. He may have been the first-ancestor of just the size of his abstract thinking, or maybe someone further up the tree had that size. That size of abstract thinking may have shown up in someone else for whom their common ancestor may be many more generations behind Einstein's first ancestor who had that size of abstract thinking.</p>

<p>Here, we use the phrase "show up" as opposed to "evolve". Evolve connotates mutation and recombination. Mutations are very infrequent. Recombination has to be the main engine for new, polymorphic features. A highly polygenic feature, such as intelligence, "mutates" with every individual, producing brand new intelligences with every child. However, eye color is not very polygenic, and therefore eye-color evolution <em>is</em> indeed bound by genetic mutation.</p>

<h1>MRCA</h1>

<p>The Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) of my brother and me is my mom and my father.</p>

<p>By definition, the MRCA of humans is the most recent individual (or possibly a couple, if they were exclusive mates) from whom all humans are descended from. MRCA existed in some tribe, and their contemporaries contributed to the genes of some humans today, but none of those contemporaries are connected to all of us. If they did, and they mated more recently, then they would be the MRCA.</p>

<p>The ACA (All Common Ancestors) of humans goes further back, to some hominid, who had contemporaries, but the children of those contemporaries are not ancestors to any humans that are alive today. All of those contemporaries had bloodlines that went off to terminate in extinct hominids, like Neanderthals.</p>

<p>The MRCA didn't necessarily pass any genetic information to everyone. After 32 generations, a contribution of a single ancestor is 2^-32, or 1/(4 billion). There are only ~3 billion basepairs in the human genome.</p>

<p>The MRCA was probably someone near Alaska or Siberia whose children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren dispersed far away from each other, just before Beringia closed (10 ka) and the Australian landbridge closed (12 ka), whichever came first, leaving descendants in the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia.</p>

<p>Assuming no pedigree collapse, a single individual alive today, would over 30 generations going back to High Middle ages have 2^30, or ~1 billion ancestors, more than the total world population at the time.</p>
