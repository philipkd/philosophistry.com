<p>The challenge in meta-analyzing psychological (See: <a href="Meta-analysis_in_Psychotherapy">Meta-analysis in Psychotherapy</a>) treatments is that there is a lack of what's called "homogeneity" in both treatments and conditions. Treatments could include ones as methodical as cognitive therapy; it could include ones as unstructured as conversations with a counselor; or, it could include in-between treatments, such as classic Freudian psychoanalysis, which involves exploring the meaning behind dreams or negative thoughts.</p>

<p>The consensus in the scientific community is that "cognitive therapy works."</p>

<p>There isn't consensus among ordinary people that "talk therapy works."</p>

<h1>Definitions</h1>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>Google defines psychotherapy as "the treatment of mental disorder by psychological, rather than medical means." But per <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/couch-meets-world/201107/psychiatrist-psychotherapist-whos-who-in-mental-health">this <em>Psychology Today</em> article</a>, psychotherapy is referred to as "an umbrella term for any professional who is trained to treat people for their emotional problems." Presumably this could involve medication.</p>

<h2>Diagnostic types</h2>

<p><a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17010057">This meta-analysis</a> focused on these six diagnostic categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>mood disorders</li>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>posttraumatic stress disorder</li>
<li>eating disorders</li>
<li>personality disorders</li>
<li>substance use disorders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment types</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19045960">This meta-analysis</a> looked into "7 major types of psychological treatment" for mild to moderate adult depression.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cognitive-behavior therapy</li>
<li>Nondirective supportive treatment</li>
<li>Behavioral activation treatment</li>
<li>Psychodynamic treatment</li>
<li>Problem-solving therapy</li>
