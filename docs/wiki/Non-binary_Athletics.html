<p><strong>IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations)</strong> sets rules for track and field athletics across the world, including the Olympics</p>

<p><strong>CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport)</strong> settles sports disputes via arbitration. Olypmics disputes must be submitted to CAS. CAS can be overruled in appeal to Supreme Court of Switzerland.</p>

<h1>IAAF Policy as of Jun 2019</h1>

<p>IAAF policy requires DSD (Disorders of sex development) athletes to reduce testosterone to less than 5 nmol/L for events between 400m and 1 mile.</p>

<p>Standard ranges:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most females (including elite female athletes) have low levels of testosterone circulating naturally in their bodies (0.12 to 1.79 nmol/L in blood); while after puberty the normal male range is much higher (7.7 â€“ 29.4 nmol/L) (<a href="https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/eligibility-regulations-for-female-classifica">source</a>)</p>
