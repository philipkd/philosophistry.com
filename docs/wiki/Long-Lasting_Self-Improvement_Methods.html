<div class="page-title">Long-Lasting Self-Improvement Methods</div>

<p>An inventory of self-improvement methods that I've kept up for more than a year.</p>

<h1>Active methods</h1>

<p><em>(as of Nov 2018, starting with the longest)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Turn on your headlights every time you start the car</li>
<li>Don't journal your introspections</li>
<li>Put your alarm away from your bed</li>
<li>Every 3 months collect your income statements and itemize them</li>
<li>Daily 30-min breath-monitoring meditation

<ul>
<li>Meditation calendar: <a href="images/meditation-calendar.png">cross off every day you meditate</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Every 15 days categorize your expenses on <a href="https://mint.com/">Mint</a></li>
<li>Put receipts for grocery purchases and leftovers on your fridge and then cross off items you eat</li>
<li>Write an x in your phone for every drink you plan on having that night, then delete an x for every drink you have</li>
<li>Timed stretching: use an Apple Watch to set 18-sec timers for stretches[1][2]</li>
<li>Lazy stretching: do as many stretches standing up as you feel like, then do the same on the mat</li>
<li>Set a 1-min. timer for brushing your teeth at night</li>
<li>High-rep weight-lifting: do 20-plus reps until tired or failure per muscle group</li>
<li>Only wash armpits, groin, and feet in the shower</li>
<li>Use an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077SXWSRP/?tag=philosophistr-20">Echo Show</a> to reach out to loved ones who aren't good with phones</li>
<li>Daily 15-min auto-meditation: do activities, such as using the sauna, that feel like meditations</li>
</ul>

<p><em>[1] Certain timers can only be practical if they're extremely easy-to-use.</em></p>

<p><em>[2] Timers are more effective at compliance than counting in your head or estimating a length of time.</em></p>

<h1>Inactive methods</h1>

<ul>
<li>Charge your phone away from your bed when you sleep — <em>Great for getting yourself out of bed, but phones are also good for distracting away from over-introspection</em></li>
<li>Hold your razor loose to prevent knicks — <em>I use an electric now</em></li>
<li>Take the first two numbers of your monthly spending and convert all purchases into those units — <em><a href="https://medium.com/@philipkd/how-i-finally-reined-in-my-spending-a1255a6f2736">It made me penny-wise, pound-foolish</a></em></li>
<li>Drink a maximum of 1 drink per day</li>
</ul>

<h1>Definition of method</h1>

<p><strong>method</strong>: a neologism for any mantra, system, shortcut, life-hack, or idea that you repeat in your head in order to bring about a desired behavior.</p>

<p><strong>method abuse</strong>: when you repeat a method so much that it does more harm than good.</p>
