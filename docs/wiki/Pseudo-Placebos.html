<p>Placebos become pseudo-placebos when patients are told that they are part of a study that includes them. Pure placebo conditions would require not informing patients that they're getting placebos. This way, no matter what the treatment they get, they'll respond with, "Wow, I think this is working!" Otherwise, when informed about the trial's configuration, they'll react with, "Wow, this may be working or it may just be in my head!"</p>
