<p>The main counterarguments to <a href="Inevitability_of_Life">Inevitability of Life</a> seem to accord with the Anthropic Principle. The anthropicist would say, "Of course everything <em>seems</em> inevitable." This just stops thinking, though. The principle technically adds nothing, because it's a tautology. Of course, observations of the Universe must be compatible with conditions that give rise to intelligent observers. That doesn't mean we can't make <em>some</em> conclusions about our inevitability by looking to the past.</p>
