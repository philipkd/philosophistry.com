# Does talk therapy work?

The subject of this essay is a can of worms. I'm looking for something similar to studies that asked a seemingly innocent question, "does medicine work?" In other words, if I enter the hospital, will I come out better or worse? Around 1900, which is when the Showtime hospital drama *The Knick* is set, it's unclear whether medicine does better than 50-50. Medicine was just at the point where it was shedding the treatment of "humors" and beginning to apply cocaine for everything, i.e. it still wasn't that great. By now, though, it's obvious that modern medicine works. Or is it? (At least for the elderly, there are some questions. About one-third of patients over 70, and more than half of those over 85 leave the hospital worse than when they arrived. ([source](https://khn.org/news/elderly-hospital-patients-arrive-sick-often-leave-disabled/))) So, is the field of psychotherapy like medicine in 1900? Are we still treating humors of the mind? Or does it actually work?

In the 1990s, I used to bandy out the statistic, true or not, that "one-third of patients who enter psychotherapy get better, one-third get worse, and one-third stay the same." Everybody who I shopped this to seemed to nod in agreement, or at best, couldn't respond definitively that I was wrong. It's the 2010s, though, and we can do much better than the vague fielding of received wisdom, thanks to the power of meta-analysis. A meta-analysis is a study of studies, and ideally this should be as close as we can get to "the truth." Or is it? Meta-analyses can disagree. For example, a meta-analysis of studies in the West show that accupuncture doesn't work. A meta-analysis of studies in the East show that it does. Who do you believe?

Before diving into the answer, let's take an aside about definitions. The labels from the field of psychology are confusing. Should you see a psychotherapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist? Google defines psychotherapy as "the treatment of mental disorder by psychological, rather than medical means" but this [*Psychology Today* article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/couch-meets-world/201107/psychiatrist-psychotherapist-whos-who-in-mental-health) defines "psychotherapists" as "an umbrella term for any professional who is trained to treat people for their emotional problems." I'm sticking with "talk therapy." I want to clearly divide psychotherapy into two categories: treatment for mental health that involves drugs, and treatment that doesn't. This essay concerns itself with the latter only. Drug treatment for the mind *is* more mature than it was in the 1990s. Arguably, the 90s were like 1900 for mental health, but instead of cocaine it was Prozac. [Now, it's clearer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2018/02/24/about-antidepressant-study/) which drugs work and which don't, although we're still not at penicilin-level effect sizes. For talk therapy, the results aren't as clear. 

The gold standard for meta-analysis is Cochrane[1]. They are a consortium of volunteers across the globe who are divided into 53 working groups focused on all sorts of medical topics, not just mental health, who've come together to create the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (SR is a close synonym with meta-analysis). Cochrane is like a wiki, but just for health-related science academics. While there are many Cochrane reviews for individual treatments, such as cognitive therapy, there are none on talk therapy overall.

The problem with talk therapy meta-analysis is that there are too many diagnostic categories and too many treatment options.

Diagnoses:

* Depression
* Anxiety
* Eating disorders
* Somatic problems
* Drug dependence
* Psychosis

Treatments:

* Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT)
* Nondirective supportive treatment
* Behavioral activation treatment
* Psychodynamic treatment
* Problem-solving therapy
* Interpersonal psychotherapy
* Social skills training

And drilling down further, the diagnoses and treatments themselves aren't clearly defined. Depression can be anything from feeling blue but still showing up to work, to having a debilitating suicidalism. Psychodynamic therapy could be as archaic as Freudian dream-analysis or it could be more akin to undirected conversations that focus on the meaning behind what you choose to say. Of the seven treatments, CBT has the most defined structure. As far as I know, is the only talk therapy treatment that is unambigiously positive for multiple diagnostic categories according to Cochrane.[2]

That's as far as science literature takes us. You can Google "meta-analysis psychotherapy" and the first result looks promising until you read more closely and see that it's about the murky merits of treatment options relative to each other. It's not a slam-dunk, "patient-in, patient-out" kind of result. There are plenty of meta-analyses that say psychotherapy works, and plenty that say it doesn't. I don't trust the non-Cochrane ones. A common problem is that the meta-analyses are sponsored by an interest group, like the American Psychiatric Association, who have vested interests in promulgating their field. I'm not saying that only meta-analyses from Cochrane should be trusted, but rather that the group is collaborative enough that if it's easy to produce a meta-analysis that shows talk therapy works, a few should emerge on Cochrane as well. Furthermore, the first result for meta-analysis on Google would be chock full of clear-cut cases. But by the time we get to that point, the received wisdom will already be that talk theray works, and so the exercise will be moot.

The logical approach, then, is to find a talk therapist who practices CBT. I tried to do this once for a friend, and I can see why they were daunted by the task. First you have to find the list of providers that accept your insurance. Then you have to sort by specialty, or barring that, cross-reference their name with Google to see if they practice CBT. Then you have to call them, one-by-one. Not only that, in nearly all cases, the call goes straight to voicemail. For the ones that I could get ahold of, I asked if they practiced CBT, to which they often replied that they incorporated CBT as one tool of many in their practice. Unfortunately, Cochrane's seal of approval doesn't apply to "the practice of CBT as one tool of many."
